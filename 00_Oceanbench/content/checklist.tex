\section*{Checklist}

% %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist follows the references.  Please
% read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these
% questions.  For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
% \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.  You are strongly encouraged to include a {\bf
% justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
% your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~\ref{gen_inst}.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
% \end{itemize}
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
% limit.  In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the
% Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item For all authors...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
    \answerYes{All the contributions listed in the abstract are elaborated in sections~\ref{sec:code_structure},~\ref{sec:data_challenges} and~\ref{sec:conclusions}}
  \item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
    \answerYes{See the last paragraph of section 5 and the appendix as well.}
  \item Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?
    \answerYes{We do not believe that our work has any potential negative societal impacts directly as we do not deal with any confidential or private data. However, we do outline in the appendix how there may be some adverse effects related to downstream uses which could have some negative societal impacts.}
  \item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
    \answerYes{We do not include any confidential or private data. We only include numerical values which stem from general physical systems or machine learning models. We do not believe they hold any ethical issues. However, we do acknowledge that there would be environmental damage should users go forward and explore methods which obscenely high computing hours. This discussion outlined in the appendix.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are including theoretical results...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{We do not include any theoretical results.}
	\item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{We do not include any theoretical results.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you ran experiments (e.g. for benchmarks)...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
    \answerYes{We include the parameters used to reproduce the dataset preprocessing and evaluation procedure in Appendix \ref{sec:data_challenges_extended} and instructions are given to download the data via~\href{https://github.com/quentinf00/oceanbench-data-registry}{https://github.com/quentinf00/oceanbench-data-registry} and rerun the evaluation procedure in our code repository which is available at~\href{https://github.com/jejjohnson/oceanbench}{https://github.com/jejjohnson/oceanbench}.}
  \item Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)?
    \answerYes{We showcase all preprocessing steps necessary to reproduce the experimental configurations in Appendix~\ref{sec:data_challenges_extended} and the configuration files are available in our code repository at~\href{https://github.com/jejjohnson/oceanbench}{https://github.com/jejjohnson/oceanbench}. }
	\item Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?
    \answerNA{This is not applicable for this instantiation because we do not include any randomness within the experiment procedure nor the results.}
	\item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
    \answerYes{We do not do any model training and leave it up the user for their local or cloud machine. However, we do provide the cloud provider for the data found the the data registry which can be found at~\href{https://github.com/quentinf00/oceanbench-data-registry}{https://github.com/quentinf00/oceanbench-data-registry}}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators?
    \answerYes{We adopted the implementation of the preprocessing procedures and evaluation steps with some modifications. We give proper citation and credit to the authors as well as all other existing software packages included in this work.}
  \item Did you mention the license of the assets?
    \answerYes{The appropriate license notices are included in the source code files.}
  \item Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL?
    \answerYes{All the processing and evaluation scripts are included in the GitHub repository.}
  \item Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you're using/curating?
    \answerYes{We only include data that is already publicly available. We also discussed with the original generators of the datasets and keep the appropriate licenses.}
  \item Did you discuss whether the data you are using/curating contains personally identifiable information or offensive content?
    \answerNA{We do not include any personal information or offensive content in our datasets.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable?
    \answerNA{We do not use crowdsourcing and we do not conduct research with human subjects.}
  \item Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?
    \answerNA{See the previous point.}
  \item Did you include the estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation?
    \answerNA{See the previous point.}
\end{enumerate}
