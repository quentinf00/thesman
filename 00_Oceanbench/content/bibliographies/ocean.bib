@article{OCEANCARBONCYCLE,
	abstract = { The ocean holds vast quantities of carbon that it continually exchanges with the atmosphere through the air-sea interface. Because of its enormous size and relatively rapid exchange of carbon with the atmosphere, the ocean controls atmospheric CO2 concentration and thereby Earth's climate on timescales of tens to thousands of years. This review examines the basic functions of the ocean's carbon cycle, demonstrating that the ocean carbon inventory is determined primarily by the mass of the ocean, by the chemical speciation of CO2 in seawater, and by the action of the solubility and biological pumps that draw carbon into the ocean's deeper layers, where it can be sequestered for decades to millennia. The ocean also plays a critical role in moderating the impacts of climate change by absorbing an amount of carbon equivalent to about 25\% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the past several decades. However, this also leads to ocean acidification and reduces the chemical buffering capacity of the ocean and its future ability to take up CO2. This review closes with a look at the uncertain future of the ocean carbon cycle and the scientific challenges that this uncertainty brings. },

@article{OCEANHEATUPTAKE,
	abstract = {The ocean is the main source of thermal inertia in the climate system1. During recent decades, ocean heat uptake has been quantified by using hydrographic temperature measurements and data from the Argo float program, which expanded its coverage after 20072,3. However, these estimates all use the same imperfect ocean dataset and share additional uncertainties resulting from sparse coverage, especially before 20074,5. Here we provide an independent estimate by using measurements of atmospheric oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2)---levels of which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases---as a whole-ocean thermometer. We show that the ocean gained 1.33 $\pm$0.20  Ã—1022 joules of heat per year between 1991 and 2016, equivalent to a planetary energy imbalance of 0.83 $\pm$0.11 watts per square metre of Earth's surface. We also find that the ocean-warming effect that led to the outgassing of O2 and CO2 can be isolated from the direct effects of anthropogenic emissions and CO2 sinks. Our result---which relies on high-precision O2 measurements dating back to 19916---suggests that ocean warming is at the high end of previous estimates, with implications for policy-relevant measurements of the Earth response to climate change, such as climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases7 and the thermal component of sea-level rise8.},

@article{OCEANSATELLITEOC,
	abstract = {Spectrally resolved water-leaving radiances (ocean colour) and inferred chlorophyll concentration are key to studying phytoplankton dynamics at seasonal and inter-annual scales, for a better understanding of the role of phytoplankton in marine biogeochemistry; the global carbon cycle; and the response of marine ecosystems to climate variability, change and feedback processes. Ocean colour data also have a critical role in operational observation systems monitoring coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and sediment plumes. The contiguous ocean-colour record reached 21 years in 2018; however, it is comprised of a number of one-off missions such that creating a consistent time-series of ocean-colour data requires merging of the individual sensors (including MERIS, Aqua-MODIS, SeaWiFS, VIIRS, and OLCI) with differing sensor characteristics, without introducing artefacts. By contrast, the next decade will see consistent observations from operational ocean colour series with sensors of similar design and with a replacement strategy. Also, by 2029 the record will start to be of sufficient duration to discriminate climate change impacts from natural variability, at least in some regions. This paper describes the current status and future prospects in the field of ocean colour focusing on large to medium resolution observations of oceans and coastal seas. It reviews the user requirements in terms of products and uncertainty characteristics and then describes features of current and future satellite ocean-colour sensors, both operational and innovative. The key role of in situ validation and calibration is highlighted as are ground segments that process the data received from the ocean-colour sensors and deliver analysis-ready products to end-users. Example applications of the ocean-colour data are presented, focusing on the climate data record and operational applications including water quality and assimilation into numerical models. Current capacity building and training activities pertinent to ocean colour are described and finally a summary of future perspectives is provided.},

@article{OCEANSATELLITESST,
	abstract = {Sea-surface temperature (SST) was one of the first ocean variables to be studied from earth observation satellites. Pioneering images from infrared scanning radiometers revealed the complexity of the surface temperature fields, but these were derived from radiance measurements at orbital heights and included the effects of the intervening atmosphere. Corrections for the effects of the atmosphere to make quantitative estimates of the SST became possible when radiometers with multiple infrared channels were deployed in 1979. At the same time, imaging microwave radiometers with SST capabilities were also flown. Since then, SST has been derived from infrared and microwave radiometers on polar orbiting satellites and from infrared radiometers on geostationary spacecraft. As the performances of satellite radiometers and SST retrieval algorithms improved, accurate, global, high resolution, frequently sampled SST fields became fundamental to many research and operational activities. Here we provide an overview of the physics of the derivation of SST and the history of the development of satellite instruments over half a century. As demonstrated accuracies increased, they stimulated scientific research into the oceans, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system and the climate. We provide brief overviews of the development of some applications, including the feasibility of generating Climate Data Records. We summarize the important role of the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) in providing a forum for scientists and operational practitioners to discuss problems and results, and to help coordinate activities world-wide, including alignment of data formatting and protocols and research. The challenges of burgeoning data volumes, data distribution and analysis have benefited from simultaneous progress in computing power, high capacity storage, and communications over the Internet, so we summarize the development and current capabilities of data archives. We conclude with an outlook of developments anticipated in the next decade or so.},

@article{DAGEOSCIENCE,
	abstract = {We commonly refer to state estimation theory in geosciences as data assimilation (DA). This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. DA is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean, and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of DA, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems, and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences, an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of DA being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of DA and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.

@article{OKUBO,
	abstract = {A singular point in a two-dimensional velocity field is a stationary point of flow. The simplest and most important singularities in oceanography are points of convergence (or divergence), neutral points, and lines of convergence (or divergence). In the neighbourhood of the singularity, the velocity field is approximated linearly in terms of coordinates whose origin is taken at the singularity. The linear velocity field thus considered consists of the rates of stretching deformation and shearing deformation, vorticity, and divergence (or negative convergence). A group of foreign particles initially arranged in a circle surrounding a singularity will be deformed into an ellipse the area of which increases or decreases with time depending on the sign of the divergence. When a random motion is superposed upon the velocity field, a group of particles will be subject to advection-diffusion. As a result of the combined action of the rates of stretching and shearing, vorticity, and random motion, the group size tends to grow against a collecting power of convergence toward the singularity. Asymptotically a stationary situation may be established in which a group of particles attains a certain limiting size. Only the theoretical aspect is considered.},

@article{OKUBOWEISS,
	abstract = {The Okubo (1970 Deep Sea Res.  17 445)--Weiss (1991 Physica D 48 273) criterion, has been extensively used as a diagnostic tool to divide a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamical flow field into hyperbolic and elliptic regions and to serve as a useful qualitative guide to the complex quantitative criteria. The Okubo--Weiss criterion is frequently validated on empirical grounds by the results ensuing its application. So, we will explore topological implications into the Okubo--Weiss criterion and show the Okubo--Weiss parameter is, to within a positive multiplicative factor, the negative of the Gaussian curvature of the vorticity manifold. The Okubo--Weiss criterion is then reformulated in polar coordinates, and is validated for several examples including the Lamb--Oseen vortex, and the Burgers vortex. These developments are then extended to 2D quasi-geostrophic (QG) flows. The Okubo--Weiss parameter is shown to remain robust under the Î²-plane approximation to the Coriolis parameter. The Okubo--Weiss criterion is shown to be able to separate the 2D flow-field into coherent elliptic structures and hyperbolic flow configurations very well via numerical simulations of quasi-stationary vortices in QG flows. An Okubo--Weiss type criterion is formulate for 3D axisymmetric slows, and is validated via application to the round Landau--Squire Laminar jet flow.},

To gain an understanding of ocean eddies from the large volume of data produced by simulations, visualizing just the distribution of eddies at each time step is insufficient; time- variations in eddy events and phenomena must also be considered. However, existing methods cannot accurately detect and track eddy events such as amalgamation and bifurcation. In this study, we propose a new approach for eddy detection, tracking, and event visualization based on an eddy classification system. The proposed method detects streams and currents in addition to eddies, and it classifies detected eddies into several categories using the additional stream and current information. By tracking how the classified eddies vary over time, it is possible to detect events such as eddy amalgamation and bifurcation as well as the interaction between eddies and ocean currents. We visualize the detected eddies and events in a time series of images (or animation), enabling us to gain an intuitive understanding of a region of interest hidden in a high-resolution data set.},

@article{OCNHEALTH,
	abstract = {The Antarctic coast and seas are considered some of the most pristine marine systems on Earth. Their comprehensive assessment is critical because meeting ambitious conservation objectives while maintaining sustainable human uses will be increasingly challenging with growing climate change impacts, recovery from past overharvesting, and potential revision of activities permitted with future revisions of the existing governance structure. We used the Ocean Health Index (OHI) to deliver an integrated assessment of the Antarctic marine ecosystems' evolving ecological and social dimensions. The OHI provides a framework to evaluate sustainable delivery of benefits people want from healthy oceans by measuring progress toward 10 widely-held societal goals. These goals include, conservation objectives, as well as other objectives, so as to identify tradeoffs across multiple priorities. We adapted the Index to the unique aspects and data availability of Antarctica. OHI scores were calculated for each sub-region defined by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) as well as the region overall. OHI scores for conservation-related goals (biodiversity, clean water) were generally high, though with some stressor impacts (i.e., climate-driven decline of sea-ice, and pathogen pollution). However, a sensitivity test on the sea-ice habitat indicator showed biodiversity scores might be much lower in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula. Preservation of lasting special places, captured in the sense of place sub-goal, scored relatively low due to limited extent of Marine Protected Areas in the Southern Ocean. In several cases, scores are low due to under-utilization of resources, rather than environmentally unsustainable practices (e.g., food provision, natural products, tourism, and recreation). However, increased human activities would intensify the risk of pollution, pathogen contamination, and disturbance to wildlife, particularly if compounded with future climate change impacts. Therefore, scores may reflect the need to select more conservative targets for human use, articulated in international treaties, taking future risks into account. Our results highlight the need for more research on both natural and social science aspects of the Antarctic system, as well as the need to evaluate targets under different scenarios, so as to provide robust science-based advice for future decision-making in the region.},

	abstract = {Protecting the ocean has become a major goal of international policy as human activities increasingly endanger the integrity of the ocean ecosystem, often summarized as ``ocean health.'' By and large, efforts to protect the ocean have failed because, among other things, (1) the underlying socio-ecological pathways have not been properly considered, and (2) the concept of ocean health has been ill defined. Collectively, this prevents an adequate societal response as to how ocean ecosystems and their vital functions for human societies can be protected and restored. We review the confusion surrounding the term ``ocean health'' and suggest an operational ocean-health framework in line with the concept of strong sustainability. Given the accelerating degeneration of marine ecosystems, the restoration of regional ocean health will be of increasing importance. Our advocated transdisciplinary and multi-actor framework can help to advance the implementation of more active measures to restore ocean health and safeguard human health and well-being.},
