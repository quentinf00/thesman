@article{SSHInterpAttention,
	abstract = {Understanding of geoscience relies on spatio-temporal continuous fields, such as Sea Surface Height (SSH). Data reconstruction for restoring spatio-temporal continuous and gridded maps from incomplete observations and inaccuracy interpolation products has long been a crucial challenge in the marine geoscience. Despite remarkable progress, most existing learning-based reconstruction methods neglect to fully and discriminatively utilize the inter-layer and intra-layer features. The inter-layer semantics are complementary, and the significance of intra-layer components varies with frequency. To address these issues, we propose a multi-layer Feature Combination Network based on Attention mechanism (FCANet) for SSH data reconstruction. Specifically, a novel trainable Multi-layer Feature Combination Block (MFCB) is developed to enrich the features through inter-layer dependencies. Dual attention mechanism is introduced into the MFCB to enhance saliency of intra-layer features by adaptively rescaling the spatial-wise and channel-wise features. Furthermore, experimental results on SSH variable demonstrate the superiority of our FCANet over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods in the metrics of RMSE and SSIM.},

@article{SSHInterpConvLSTM,
	abstract = {Abstract Gridded sea surface height (SSH) maps estimated from satellite altimetry are widely used for estimating surface ocean geostrophic currents. Satellite altimeters observe SSH along one-dimensional tracks widely spaced in space and time, making accurately reconstructing the two-dimensional (2D) SSH field challenging. Traditionally, SSH is mapped using optimal interpolation (OI). However, OI artificially smooths the SSH field leading to high mapping errors in regions with rapidly-evolving mesoscale features such as western boundary currents. Motivated by the dynamical relation between SSH and sea surface temperature (SST) and the notion that even the chaotic evolution of mesoscale ocean turbulence may contain repeating patterns, we outline a deep learning (DL) approach where a neural network is trained to reconstruct 2D SSH by synthesizing altimetry and SST observations. In the Gulf Stream Extension region, dominated by mesoscale variability, our DL method substantially improves the SSH reconstruction compared to existing methods. Our SSH map has 17\% lower root-mean-square error and resolves spatial scales 30\% smaller than OI compared against independent altimeter observations. Surface geostrophic currents calculated from our map are closer to surface drifter observations and appear qualitatively more realistic, with stronger currents, a clearer separation between the Gulf Stream and neighboring eddies, and the appearance of smaller coherent eddies missed by other methods. Our map yields significant re-estimations of important dynamical quantities such as eddy kinetic energy, vorticity, and strain rate. Applying our DL method to produce a global SSH product may provide a more accurate and higher resolution product for studying mesoscale ocean turbulence.},

	abstract = {Image inpainting has been widely exploited in the field of computer vision and image processing. The main purpose of image inpainting is to produce visually plausible structure and texture for the missing regions of damaged images. In the past decade, the success of deep learning has brought new opportunities to many vision tasks, which promoted the development of a large number of deep learning-based image inpainting methods. Although these methods have many similarities, they also have their own characteristics due to the differences in data types, application scenarios, computing platforms, etc. It is necessary to classify and summarize these methods to provide a reference for the research community. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of recent advances in deep learning-based image inpainting. First, we categorize the deep learning-based techniques from multiple perspectives: inpainting strategies, network structures, and loss functions. Second, we summarize the open source codes and representative public datasets, and introduce the evaluation metrics for quantitative comparisons. Third, we summarize the real-world applications of image inpainting in different scenarios, and give a detailed analysis on the performance of different inpainting algorithms. At last, we conclude the survey and discuss about the future directions.},

Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection, wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India, East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative, downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92\% prevalence), invisible, delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer and more robust systems for all.},

abstract = {AbstractCoupled climate simulations that span several hundred years cannot be run at a high-enough spatial resolution to resolve mesoscale ocean dynamics. Recently, several studies have considered Deep Learning to parameterize subgrid forcing within macroscale ocean equations using data from ocean-only simulations with idealized geometry. We present a stochastic Deep Learning parameterization that is trained on data generated by CM2.6, a high-resolution state-of-the-art coupled climate model. We train a Convolutional Neural Network for the subgrid momentum forcing using macroscale surface velocities from a few selected subdomains with different dynamical regimes. At each location of the coarse grid, rather than predicting a single number for the subgrid momentum forcing, we predict both the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian probability distribution. This approach requires training our neural network to minimize a negative log-likelihood loss function rather than the Mean Square Error, which has been the standard in applications of Deep Learning to the problem of parameterizations. Each estimate of the conditional mean subgrid forcing is thus associated with an uncertainty estimate – the standard deviation – which will form the basis for a stochastic subgrid parameterization. Offline tests show that our parameterization generalizes well to the global oceans and a climate with increased levels without further training. We then implement our learned stochastic parameterization in an eddy-permitting idealized shallow water model. The implementation is stable and improves some statistics of the flow. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining Deep Learning tools with a probabilistic approach in parameterizing unresolved ocean dynamics.}

@article{DINEOF,
	abstract = {A method for the reconstruction of missing data based on an EOF decomposition has been applied to a large data set, a test case of Sea Surface Temperature satellite images of the Adriatic Sea. The EOF decomposition is realised with a Lanczos method, which allows optimising computational time for large matrices. The results show that the reconstruction method leads to accurate reconstructions as well as a low cpu time when dealing with realistic cases. The method has been tested with different amounts of missing data, artificially adding clouds ranging from 40\% to 80\% of data loss, and then compared to the same data set with no missing data. A comparison with in situ data has also been made. These validation studies show that results are robust, even when the amount of missing data is very high. The reconstruction of the data from the Adriatic Sea shows realistic features and a reliable temperature distribution. In addition, the method is compared to an Optimal Interpolation reconstruction. The results obtained with both methods are very similar. The main difference is the computational time, which is reduced nearly 30 times with the method presented here. Once the reconstruction has been performed, the EOF decomposition is analysed to show the method's reliability, and a cold event on the Albanian coast is studied. The reconstructed data reflect the effect of wind on the Albanian coast, that led to a cold-water episode in this zone for a 6-day period. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, ocean and atmosphere sciences face a deluge of data from space, in situ monitoring as well as numerical simulations. The availability of these different data sources offers new opportunities, still largely underexploited, to improve the understanding, modeling, and reconstruction of geophysical dynamics. The classical way to reconstruct the space-time variations of a geophysical system from observations relies on data assimilation methods using multiple runs of the known dynamical model. This classical framework may have severe limitations including its computational cost, the lack of adequacy of the model with observed data, and modeling uncertainties. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach and develop a fully data-driven framework, which combines machine learning and statistical sampling to simulate the dynamics of complex system. As a proof concept, we address the assimilation of the chaotic Lorenz-63 model. We demonstrate that a nonparametric sampler from a catalog of historical datasets, namely, a nearest neighbor or analog sampler, combined with a classical stochastic data assimilation scheme, the ensemble Kalman filter and smoother, reaches state-of-the-art performances, without online evaluations of the physical model.},

Such methods are trained on a paired dataset, where an image from the source domain already has a corresponding translated image in the target domain. However, this paired dataset requirement imposes a huge practical constraint, requires domain knowledge or is even impossible to obtain in certain cases. Due to these problems, unsupervised image-to-image translation has been proposed, which does not require domain expertise and can take advantage of a large unlabeled dataset. Although such models perform well, they are hard to train due to the major constraints induced in their loss functions, which make training unstable. Since CycleGAN has been released, numerous methods have been proposed which try to address various problems from different perspectives. In this review, we firstly describe the general image-to-image translation framework and discuss the datasets and metrics involved in the topic. Furthermore, we revise the current state-of-the-art with a classification of existing works. This part is followed by a small quantitative evaluation, for which results were taken from papers.},

@incollection{DEEPUNFOLDING,
	abstract = {Model-based methods and learning-based methods have been the two dominant strategies for solving various image restoration problems in low-level vision. Typically, those two kinds of methods have their respective merits and drawbacks, e.g., model-based methods are flexible for handling different image restoration problems but are usually time-consuming with sophisticated priors for the purpose of good performance; meanwhile, learning-based methods are continuously showing superior effectiveness and efficiency over traditional model-based methods, largely due to the end-to-end training, but generally lack the flexibility to handle different image restoration tasks. In this chapter, we attempt to provide a gentle introduction to deep plug-and-play methods and deep unfolding methods, which have shown great promise by leveraging both learning-based methods and model-based methods. The main idea of deep plug-and-play methods is that, with the aid of variable splitting techniques, a learning-based denoiser can implicitly serve as the image prior for model-based image restoration methods, while the main idea of deep unfolding methods is that, by unfolding the model-based methods via variable splitting algorithms, an end-to-end trainable, iterative network can be obtained by replacing the corresponding subproblems with neural modules. As a result, the deep plug-and-play methods and deep unfolding methods can inherit the flexibility of model-based methods, while maintaining the advantages of learning-based methods. Experimental results on two representative image restoration tasks, including deblurring and superresolution, demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of deep plug-and-play methods and deep unfolding methods.},

@article{KRIGINGREVIEW,
	abstract = {Despite an ever-increasing number of spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based data acquisition platforms, remote sensing data are still often spatially incomplete or temporally irregular. While deterministic interpolation techniques are often used, they tend to create unrealistic spatial patterns and generally do not provide uncertainty quantification. Geostatistical simulation models are effective in generating an ensemble of realistic and equally probable realizations of an unmeasured phenomenon, allowing data uncertainty to be propagated. These models are commonly used in several fields of earth science, and in recent years, they have been applied widely to remotely sensed data. This study provides the first review of the applications of geostatistical simulation to remote sensing data. We review recent geostatistical simulation models relevant to satellite remote sensing data and discuss the characteristics and advantages of each approach. Finally, the applications of each geostatistical simulation model are categorized in different domains of natural sciences, including soil, vegetation, topography, and atmospheric science.},

  abstract = 	 {Recent work has sought to understand the behavior of neural networks by comparing representations between layers and between different trained models. We examine methods for comparing neural network representations based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We show that CCA belongs to a family of statistics for measuring multivariate similarity, but that neither CCA nor any other statistic that is invariant to invertible linear transformation can measure meaningful similarities between representations of higher dimension than the number of data points. We introduce a similarity index that measures the relationship between representational similarity matrices and does not suffer from this limitation. This similarity index is equivalent to centered kernel alignment (CKA) and is also closely connected to CCA. Unlike CCA, CKA can reliably identify correspondences between representations in networks trained from different initializations.}

We apply this to a numerical simulation of idealized, doubly periodic quasi-geostrophic flows, that is, the flow is constrained by the Coriolis force and vertical stratification. The double periodicity allows for a straightforward Fourier analysis as the baseline method. Our wavelet spectra agree well with the canonical Fourier approach but with the additional strengths of negating the necessity for the data to be periodic and being able to extract local anisotropies in the flow. Caution is warranted, however, when computing higher-order quantities, such as spectral flux.},

@article{DENOISESWOT,
	abstract = {The SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography) mission will provide high-resolution and two-dimensional measurements of sea surface height (SSH). However, despite its unprecedented precision, SWOT&rsquo;s Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) still exhibits a substantial amount of random noise. In turn, the random noise limits the ability of SWOT to capture the smallest scales of the ocean&rsquo;s topography and its derivatives. In that context, this paper explores the feasibility, strengths and limits of a noise-reduction algorithm based on a convolutional neural network. The model is based on a U-Net architecture and is trained and tested with simulated data from the North Atlantic. Our results are compared to classical smoothing methods: a median filter, a Lanczos kernel smoother and the SWOT de-noising algorithm developed by Gomez-Navarro et al. Our U-Net model yields better results for all the evaluation metrics: 2 mm root mean square error, sub-millimetric bias, variance reduction by factor of 44 (16 dB) and an accurate power spectral density down to 10&ndash;20 km wavelengths. We also tested various scenarios to infer the robustness and the stability of the U-Net. The U-Net always exhibits good performance and can be further improved with retraining if necessary. This robustness in simulation is very encouraging: our findings show that the U-Net architecture is likely one of the best candidates to reduce the noise of flight data from KaRIn.},

@article{MLSSC,
	abstract = {Global surface currents are usually inferred from directly observed quantities like sea-surface height, wind stress by applying diagnostic balance relations (like geostrophy and Ekman flow), which provide a good approximation of the dynamics of slow, large-scale currents at large scales and low Rossby numbers. However, newer generation satellite altimeters (like the upcoming SWOT mission) will capture more of the high wavenumber variability associated with the unbalanced components, but the low temporal sampling can potentially lead to aliasing. Applying these balances directly may lead to an incorrect un-physical estimate of the surface flow. In this study we explore Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as an alternate route to infer surface currents from satellite observable quantities. We train our ML models with SSH, SST, and wind stress from available primitive equation ocean GCM simulation outputs as the inputs and make predictions of surface currents (u,v), which are then compared against the true GCM output. As a baseline example, we demonstrate that a linear regression model is ineffective at predicting velocities accurately beyond localized regions. In comparison, a relatively simple neural network (NN) can predict surface currents accurately over most of the global ocean, with lower mean squared errors than geostrophy + Ekman. Using a local stencil of neighboring grid points as additional input features, we can train the deep learning models to effectively ``learn'' spatial gradients and the physics of surface currents. By passing the stenciled variables through convolutional filters we can help the model learn spatial gradients much faster. Various training strategies are explored using systematic feature hold out and multiple combinations of point and stenciled input data fed through convolutional filters (2D/3D), to understand the effect of each input feature on the NN's ability to accurately represent surface flow. A model sensitivity analysis reveals that besides SSH, geographic information in some form is an essential ingredient required for making accurate predictions of surface currents with deep learning models.},

@article{SSTFLOWANOMALY,
	abstract = {Abstract Gridded sea surface height (SSH) maps estimated from satellite altimetry are widely used for estimating surface ocean geostrophic currents. Satellite altimeters observe SSH along one-dimensional tracks widely spaced in space and time, making accurately reconstructing the two-dimensional (2D) SSH field challenging. Traditionally, SSH is mapped using optimal interpolation (OI). However, OI artificially smooths the SSH field leading to high mapping errors in regions with rapidly-evolving mesoscale features such as western boundary currents. Motivated by the dynamical relation between SSH and sea surface temperature (SST) and the notion that even the chaotic evolution of mesoscale ocean turbulence may contain repeating patterns, we outline a deep learning (DL) approach where a neural network is trained to reconstruct 2D SSH by synthesizing altimetry and SST observations. In the Gulf Stream Extension region, dominated by mesoscale variability, our DL method substantially improves the SSH reconstruction compared to existing methods. Our SSH map has 17\% lower root-mean-square error and resolves spatial scales 30\% smaller than OI compared against independent altimeter observations. Surface geostrophic currents calculated from our map are closer to surface drifter observations and appear qualitatively more realistic, with stronger currents, a clearer separation between the Gulf Stream and neighboring eddies, and the appearance of smaller coherent eddies missed by other methods. Our map yields significant re-estimations of important dynamical quantities such as eddy kinetic energy, vorticity, and strain rate. Applying our DL method to produce a global SSH product may provide a more accurate and higher resolution product for studying mesoscale ocean turbulence.},

  abstract = {Recently, a growing number of studies have used machine learning (ML) models to parameterize computationally intensive subgrid-scale processes in ocean models. Such studies typically train ML models with filtered and coarse-grained high-resolution data and evaluate their predictive performance offline, before implementing them in a coarse resolution model and assessing their online performance. In this work, we systematically benchmark the online performance of such models, their generalization to domains not encountered during training, and their sensitivity to dataset design choices. We apply this proposed framework to compare a large number of physical and neural network (NN)-based parameterizations. We find that the choice of filtering and coarse-graining operator is particularly critical and this choice should be guided by the application. We also show that all of our physics-constrained NNs are stable and perform well when implemented online, but generalize poorly to new regimes. To improve generalization and also interpretability, we propose a novel equation-discovery approach combining linear regression and genetic programming with spatial derivatives. We find this approach performs on par with neural networks on the training domain but generalizes better beyond it. We release code and data to reproduce our results and provide the research community with easy-to-use resources to develop and evaluate additional parameterizations.}

abstract = {AbstractCoupled climate simulations that span several hundred years cannot be run at a high-enough spatial resolution to resolve mesoscale ocean dynamics. Recently, several studies have considered Deep Learning to parameterize subgrid forcing within macroscale ocean equations using data from ocean-only simulations with idealized geometry. We present a stochastic Deep Learning parameterization that is trained on data generated by CM2.6, a high-resolution state-of-the-art coupled climate model. We train a Convolutional Neural Network for the subgrid momentum forcing using macroscale surface velocities from a few selected subdomains with different dynamical regimes. At each location of the coarse grid, rather than predicting a single number for the subgrid momentum forcing, we predict both the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian probability distribution. This approach requires training our neural network to minimize a negative log-likelihood loss function rather than the Mean Square Error, which has been the standard in applications of Deep Learning to the problem of parameterizations. Each estimate of the conditional mean subgrid forcing is thus associated with an uncertainty estimate – the standard deviation – which will form the basis for a stochastic subgrid parameterization. Offline tests show that our parameterization generalizes well to the global oceans and a climate with increased levels without further training. We then implement our learned stochastic parameterization in an eddy-permitting idealized shallow water model. The implementation is stable and improves some statistics of the flow. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining Deep Learning tools with a probabilistic approach in parameterizing unresolved ocean dynamics.}

	abstract = {Abstract Building accurate rainfall--runoff models is an integral part of hydrological science and practice. The variety of modeling goals and applications have led to a large suite of evaluation metrics for these models. Yet, hydrologists still put considerable trust into visual judgment, although it is unclear whether such judgment agrees or disagrees with existing quantitative metrics. In this study, we tasked 622 experts to compare and judge more than 14,000 pairs of hydrographs from 13 different models. Our results show that expert opinion broadly agrees with quantitative metrics and results in a clear preference for a Machine Learning model over traditional hydrological models. The expert opinions are, however, subject to significant amounts of inconsistency. Nevertheless, where experts agree, we can predict their opinion purely from quantitative metrics, which indicates that the metrics sufficiently encode human preferences in a small set of numbers. While there remains room for improvement of quantitative metrics, we suggest that the hydrologic community should reinforce their benchmarking efforts and put more trust in these metrics.},
