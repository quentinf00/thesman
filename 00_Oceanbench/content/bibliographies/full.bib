@article{ARGO,
	abstract = {In the past two decades, the Argo Program has collected, processed, and distributed over two million vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from the upper two kilometers of the global ocean. A similar number of subsurface velocity observations near 1,000 dbar have also been collected. This paper recounts the history of the global Argo Program, from its aspiration arising out of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, to the development and implementation of its instrumentation and telecommunication systems, and the various technical problems encountered. We describe the Argo data system and its quality control procedures, and the gradual changes in the vertical resolution and spatial coverage of Argo data from 1999 to 2019. The accuracies of the float data have been assessed by comparison with high-quality shipboard measurements, and are concluded to be 0.002$\,^{\circ}$C for temperature, 2.4 dbar for pressure, and 0.01 PSS-78 for salinity, after delayed-mode adjustments. Finally, the challenges faced by the vision of an expanding Argo Program beyond 2020 are discussed.},

@article{SSHInterpAttention,
	abstract = {Understanding of geoscience relies on spatio-temporal continuous fields, such as Sea Surface Height (SSH). Data reconstruction for restoring spatio-temporal continuous and gridded maps from incomplete observations and inaccuracy interpolation products has long been a crucial challenge in the marine geoscience. Despite remarkable progress, most existing learning-based reconstruction methods neglect to fully and discriminatively utilize the inter-layer and intra-layer features. The inter-layer semantics are complementary, and the significance of intra-layer components varies with frequency. To address these issues, we propose a multi-layer Feature Combination Network based on Attention mechanism (FCANet) for SSH data reconstruction. Specifically, a novel trainable Multi-layer Feature Combination Block (MFCB) is developed to enrich the features through inter-layer dependencies. Dual attention mechanism is introduced into the MFCB to enhance saliency of intra-layer features by adaptively rescaling the spatial-wise and channel-wise features. Furthermore, experimental results on SSH variable demonstrate the superiority of our FCANet over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods in the metrics of RMSE and SSIM.},

@article{SSHInterpConvLSTM,
	abstract = {Abstract Gridded sea surface height (SSH) maps estimated from satellite altimetry are widely used for estimating surface ocean geostrophic currents. Satellite altimeters observe SSH along one-dimensional tracks widely spaced in space and time, making accurately reconstructing the two-dimensional (2D) SSH field challenging. Traditionally, SSH is mapped using optimal interpolation (OI). However, OI artificially smooths the SSH field leading to high mapping errors in regions with rapidly-evolving mesoscale features such as western boundary currents. Motivated by the dynamical relation between SSH and sea surface temperature (SST) and the notion that even the chaotic evolution of mesoscale ocean turbulence may contain repeating patterns, we outline a deep learning (DL) approach where a neural network is trained to reconstruct 2D SSH by synthesizing altimetry and SST observations. In the Gulf Stream Extension region, dominated by mesoscale variability, our DL method substantially improves the SSH reconstruction compared to existing methods. Our SSH map has 17\% lower root-mean-square error and resolves spatial scales 30\% smaller than OI compared against independent altimeter observations. Surface geostrophic currents calculated from our map are closer to surface drifter observations and appear qualitatively more realistic, with stronger currents, a clearer separation between the Gulf Stream and neighboring eddies, and the appearance of smaller coherent eddies missed by other methods. Our map yields significant re-estimations of important dynamical quantities such as eddy kinetic energy, vorticity, and strain rate. Applying our DL method to produce a global SSH product may provide a more accurate and higher resolution product for studying mesoscale ocean turbulence.},

The main purpose of image inpainting is to produce visually plausible structure and texture for the missing regions of damaged images. In the past decade, the success of deep learning has brought new opportunities to many vision tasks, which promoted the development of a large number of deep learning-based image inpainting methods. Although these methods have many similarities, they also have their own characteristics due to the differences in data types, application scenarios, computing platforms, etc. It is necessary to classify and summarize these methods to provide a reference for the research community. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of recent advances in deep learning-based image inpainting. First, we categorize the deep learning-based techniques from multiple perspectives: inpainting strategies, network structures, and loss functions. Second, we summarize the open source codes and representative public datasets, and introduce the evaluation metrics for quantitative comparisons. Third, we summarize the real-world applications of image inpainting in different scenarios, and give a detailed analysis on the performance of different inpainting algorithms. At last, we conclude the survey and discuss about the future directions.},

Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection, wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India, East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present empirical evidence on Data Cascades‚Äîcompounding events causing negative, downstream effects from data issues‚Äîtriggered by conventional AI/ML practices that undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92\% prevalence), invisible, delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer and more robust systems for all.},

abstract = {AbstractCoupled climate simulations that span several hundred years cannot be run at a high-enough spatial resolution to resolve mesoscale ocean dynamics. Recently, several studies have considered Deep Learning to parameterize subgrid forcing within macroscale ocean equations using data from ocean-only simulations with idealized geometry. We present a stochastic Deep Learning parameterization that is trained on data generated by CM2.6, a high-resolution state-of-the-art coupled climate model. We train a Convolutional Neural Network for the subgrid momentum forcing using macroscale surface velocities from a few selected subdomains with different dynamical regimes. At each location of the coarse grid, rather than predicting a single number for the subgrid momentum forcing, we predict both the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian probability distribution. This approach requires training our neural network to minimize a negative log-likelihood loss function rather than the Mean Square Error, which has been the standard in applications of Deep Learning to the problem of parameterizations. Each estimate of the conditional mean subgrid forcing is thus associated with an uncertainty estimate ‚Äì the standard deviation ‚Äì which will form the basis for a stochastic subgrid parameterization. Offline tests show that our parameterization generalizes well to the global oceans and a climate with increased levels without further training. We then implement our learned stochastic parameterization in an eddy-permitting idealized shallow water model. The implementation is stable and improves some statistics of the flow. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining Deep Learning tools with a probabilistic approach in parameterizing unresolved ocean dynamics.}

	abstract = {A method for the reconstruction of missing data based on an EOF decomposition has been applied to a large data set, a test case of Sea Surface Temperature satellite images of the Adriatic Sea. The EOF decomposition is realised with a Lanczos method, which allows optimising computational time for large matrices. The results show that the reconstruction method leads to accurate reconstructions as well as a low cpu time when dealing with realistic cases. The method has been tested with different amounts of missing data, artificially adding clouds ranging from 40\% to 80\% of data loss, and then compared to the same data set with no missing data. A comparison with in situ data has also been made. These validation studies show that results are robust, even when the amount of missing data is very high. The reconstruction of the data from the Adriatic Sea shows realistic features and a reliable temperature distribution. In addition, the method is compared to an Optimal Interpolation reconstruction. The results obtained with both methods are very similar. The main difference is the computational time, which is reduced nearly 30 times with the method presented here. Once the reconstruction has been performed, the EOF decomposition is analysed to show the method's reliability, and a cold event on the Albanian coast is studied. The reconstructed data reflect the effect of wind on the Albanian coast, that led to a cold-water episode in this zone for a 6-day period. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, ocean and atmosphere sciences face a deluge of data from space, in situ monitoring as well as numerical simulations. The availability of these different data sources offers new opportunities, still largely underexploited, to improve the understanding, modeling, and reconstruction of geophysical dynamics. The classical way to reconstruct the space-time variations of a geophysical system from observations relies on data assimilation methods using multiple runs of the known dynamical model. This classical framework may have severe limitations including its computational cost, the lack of adequacy of the model with observed data, and modeling uncertainties. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach and develop a fully data-driven framework, which combines machine learning and statistical sampling to simulate the dynamics of complex system. As a proof concept, we address the assimilation of the chaotic Lorenz-63 model. We demonstrate that a nonparametric sampler from a catalog of historical datasets, namely, a nearest neighbor or analog sampler, combined with a classical stochastic data assimilation scheme, the ensemble Kalman filter and smoother, reaches state-of-the-art performances, without online evaluations of the physical model.},

Such methods are trained on a paired dataset, where an image from the source domain already has a corresponding translated image in the target domain. However, this paired dataset requirement imposes a huge practical constraint, requires domain knowledge or is even impossible to obtain in certain cases. Due to these problems, unsupervised image-to-image translation has been proposed, which does not require domain expertise and can take advantage of a large unlabeled dataset. Although such models perform well, they are hard to train due to the major constraints induced in their loss functions, which make training unstable. Since CycleGAN has been released, numerous methods have been proposed which try to address various problems from different perspectives. In this review, we firstly describe the general image-to-image translation framework and discuss the datasets and metrics involved in the topic. Furthermore, we revise the current state-of-the-art with a classification of existing works. This part is followed by a small quantitative evaluation, for which results were taken from papers.},

@incollection{DEEPUNFOLDING,
	abstract = {Model-based methods and learning-based methods have been the two dominant strategies for solving various image restoration problems in low-level vision. Typically, those two kinds of methods have their respective merits and drawbacks, e.g., model-based methods are flexible for handling different image restoration problems but are usually time-consuming with sophisticated priors for the purpose of good performance; meanwhile, learning-based methods are continuously showing superior effectiveness and efficiency over traditional model-based methods, largely due to the end-to-end training, but generally lack the flexibility to handle different image restoration tasks. In this chapter, we attempt to provide a gentle introduction to deep plug-and-play methods and deep unfolding methods, which have shown great promise by leveraging both learning-based methods and model-based methods. The main idea of deep plug-and-play methods is that, with the aid of variable splitting techniques, a learning-based denoiser can implicitly serve as the image prior for model-based image restoration methods, while the main idea of deep unfolding methods is that, by unfolding the model-based methods via variable splitting algorithms, an end-to-end trainable, iterative network can be obtained by replacing the corresponding subproblems with neural modules. As a result, the deep plug-and-play methods and deep unfolding methods can inherit the flexibility of model-based methods, while maintaining the advantages of learning-based methods. Experimental results on two representative image restoration tasks, including deblurring and superresolution, demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of deep plug-and-play methods and deep unfolding methods.},

	abstract = {Despite an ever-increasing number of spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based data acquisition platforms, remote sensing data are still often spatially incomplete or temporally irregular. While deterministic interpolation techniques are often used, they tend to create unrealistic spatial patterns and generally do not provide uncertainty quantification. Geostatistical simulation models are effective in generating an ensemble of realistic and equally probable realizations of an unmeasured phenomenon, allowing data uncertainty to be propagated. These models are commonly used in several fields of earth science, and in recent years, they have been applied widely to remotely sensed data. This study provides the first review of the applications of geostatistical simulation to remote sensing data. We review recent geostatistical simulation models relevant to satellite remote sensing data and discuss the characteristics and advantages of each approach. Finally, the applications of each geostatistical simulation model are categorized in different domains of natural sciences, including soil, vegetation, topography, and atmospheric science.},

We show that CCA belongs to a family of statistics for measuring multivariate similarity, but that neither CCA nor any other statistic that is invariant to invertible linear transformation can measure meaningful similarities between representations of higher dimension than the number of data points. We introduce a similarity index that measures the relationship between representational similarity matrices and does not suffer from this limitation. This similarity index is equivalent to centered kernel alignment (CKA) and is also closely connected to CCA.

The double periodicity allows for a straightforward Fourier analysis as the baseline method.

Caution is warranted, however, when computing higher-order quantities, such as spectral flux.},

@article{DENOISESWOT,
	abstract = {The SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography) mission will provide high-resolution and two-dimensional measurements of sea surface height (SSH). However, despite its unprecedented precision, SWOT&rsquo;s Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) still exhibits a substantial amount of random noise. In turn, the random noise limits the ability of SWOT to capture the smallest scales of the ocean&rsquo;s topography and its derivatives. In that context, this paper explores the feasibility, strengths and limits of a noise-reduction algorithm based on a convolutional neural network. The model is based on a U-Net architecture and is trained and tested with simulated data from the North Atlantic. Our results are compared to classical smoothing methods: a median filter, a Lanczos kernel smoother and the SWOT de-noising algorithm developed by Gomez-Navarro et al. Our U-Net model yields better results for all the evaluation metrics: 2 mm root mean square error, sub-millimetric bias, variance reduction by factor of 44 (16 dB) and an accurate power spectral density down to 10&ndash;20 km wavelengths. We also tested various scenarios to infer the robustness and the stability of the U-Net. The U-Net always exhibits good performance and can be further improved with retraining if necessary. This robustness in simulation is very encouraging: our findings show that the U-Net architecture is likely one of the best candidates to reduce the noise of flight data from KaRIn.},

@article{MLSSC,
	abstract = {Global surface currents are usually inferred from directly observed quantities like sea-surface height, wind stress by applying diagnostic balance relations (like geostrophy and Ekman flow), which provide a good approximation of the dynamics of slow, large-scale currents at large scales and low Rossby numbers. However, newer generation satellite altimeters (like the upcoming SWOT mission) will capture more of the high wavenumber variability associated with the unbalanced components, but the low temporal sampling can potentially lead to aliasing. Applying these balances directly may lead to an incorrect un-physical estimate of the surface flow. In this study we explore Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as an alternate route to infer surface currents from satellite observable quantities. We train our ML models with SSH, SST, and wind stress from available primitive equation ocean GCM simulation outputs as the inputs and make predictions of surface currents (u,v), which are then compared against the true GCM output. As a baseline example, we demonstrate that a linear regression model is ineffective at predicting velocities accurately beyond localized regions. In comparison, a relatively simple neural network (NN) can predict surface currents accurately over most of the global ocean, with lower mean squared errors than geostrophy + Ekman. Using a local stencil of neighboring grid points as additional input features, we can train the deep learning models to effectively ``learn'' spatial gradients and the physics of surface currents. By passing the stenciled variables through convolutional filters we can help the model learn spatial gradients much faster. Various training strategies are explored using systematic feature hold out and multiple combinations of point and stenciled input data fed through convolutional filters (2D/3D), to understand the effect of each input feature on the NN's ability to accurately represent surface flow. A model sensitivity analysis reveals that besides SSH, geographic information in some form is an essential ingredient required for making accurate predictions of surface currents with deep learning models.},

@article{SSTFLOWANOMALY,
	abstract = {Abstract Gridded sea surface height (SSH) maps estimated from satellite altimetry are widely used for estimating surface ocean geostrophic currents. Satellite altimeters observe SSH along one-dimensional tracks widely spaced in space and time, making accurately reconstructing the two-dimensional (2D) SSH field challenging. Traditionally, SSH is mapped using optimal interpolation (OI). However, OI artificially smooths the SSH field leading to high mapping errors in regions with rapidly-evolving mesoscale features such as western boundary currents. Motivated by the dynamical relation between SSH and sea surface temperature (SST) and the notion that even the chaotic evolution of mesoscale ocean turbulence may contain repeating patterns, we outline a deep learning (DL) approach where a neural network is trained to reconstruct 2D SSH by synthesizing altimetry and SST observations. In the Gulf Stream Extension region, dominated by mesoscale variability, our DL method substantially improves the SSH reconstruction compared to existing methods. Our SSH map has 17\% lower root-mean-square error and resolves spatial scales 30\% smaller than OI compared against independent altimeter observations. Surface geostrophic currents calculated from our map are closer to surface drifter observations and appear qualitatively more realistic, with stronger currents, a clearer separation between the Gulf Stream and neighboring eddies, and the appearance of smaller coherent eddies missed by other methods. Our map yields significant re-estimations of important dynamical quantities such as eddy kinetic energy, vorticity, and strain rate. Applying our DL method to produce a global SSH product may provide a more accurate and higher resolution product for studying mesoscale ocean turbulence.},

Such studies typically train ML models with filtered and coarse-grained high-resolution data and evaluate their predictive performance offline, before implementing them in a coarse resolution model and assessing their online performance. In this work, we systematically benchmark the online performance of such models, their generalization to domains not encountered during training, and their sensitivity to dataset design choices. We apply this proposed framework to compare a large number of physical and neural network (NN)-based parameterizations. We find that the choice of filtering and coarse-graining operator is particularly critical and this choice should be guided by the application. We also show that all of our physics-constrained NNs are stable and perform well when implemented online, but generalize poorly to new regimes. To improve generalization and also interpretability, we propose a novel equation-discovery approach combining linear regression and genetic programming with spatial derivatives. We find this approach performs on par with neural networks on the training domain but generalizes better beyond it. We release code and data to reproduce our results and provide the research community with easy-to-use resources to develop and evaluate additional parameterizations.}

abstract = {AbstractCoupled climate simulations that span several hundred years cannot be run at a high-enough spatial resolution to resolve mesoscale ocean dynamics. Recently, several studies have considered Deep Learning to parameterize subgrid forcing within macroscale ocean equations using data from ocean-only simulations with idealized geometry. We present a stochastic Deep Learning parameterization that is trained on data generated by CM2.6, a high-resolution state-of-the-art coupled climate model. We train a Convolutional Neural Network for the subgrid momentum forcing using macroscale surface velocities from a few selected subdomains with different dynamical regimes. At each location of the coarse grid, rather than predicting a single number for the subgrid momentum forcing, we predict both the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian probability distribution. This approach requires training our neural network to minimize a negative log-likelihood loss function rather than the Mean Square Error, which has been the standard in applications of Deep Learning to the problem of parameterizations. Each estimate of the conditional mean subgrid forcing is thus associated with an uncertainty estimate ‚Äì the standard deviation ‚Äì which will form the basis for a stochastic subgrid parameterization. Offline tests show that our parameterization generalizes well to the global oceans and a climate with increased levels without further training. We then implement our learned stochastic parameterization in an eddy-permitting idealized shallow water model. The implementation is stable and improves some statistics of the flow. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining Deep Learning tools with a probabilistic approach in parameterizing unresolved ocean dynamics.}

	abstract = {Abstract Building accurate rainfall--runoff models is an integral part of hydrological science and practice. The variety of modeling goals and applications have led to a large suite of evaluation metrics for these models. Yet, hydrologists still put considerable trust into visual judgment, although it is unclear whether such judgment agrees or disagrees with existing quantitative metrics. In this study, we tasked 622 experts to compare and judge more than 14,000 pairs of hydrographs from 13 different models. Our results show that expert opinion broadly agrees with quantitative metrics and results in a clear preference for a Machine Learning model over traditional hydrological models. The expert opinions are, however, subject to significant amounts of inconsistency. Nevertheless, where experts agree, we can predict their opinion purely from quantitative metrics, which indicates that the metrics sufficiently encode human preferences in a small set of numbers. While there remains room for improvement of quantitative metrics, we suggest that the hydrologic community should reinforce their benchmarking efforts and put more trust in these metrics.},

Better physics-based forecasts require improved atmospheric models, which can be difficult to discover and develop, or increasing the resolution underlying the simulation, which can be computationally prohibitive. An emerging class of weather models based on neural networks overcome these limitations by learning the required transformations from data instead of relying on hand-coded physics and by running efficiently in parallel. Here we present a neural network capable of predicting precipitation at a high resolution up to 12 h ahead. The model predicts raw precipitation targets and outperforms for up to 12 h of lead time state-of-the-art physics-based models currently operating in the Continental United States.

	abstract = {Abstract Model bias is one of the main obstacles to improved accuracy and reliability in numerical weather prediction conducted with state-of-the-art atmospheric models. To deal with model bias, a modification of the standard four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) algorithm, called weak-constraint 4D-Var, has been developed where a forcing term is introduced into the model to correct for the bias that accumulates along the model trajectory. This approach reduced the temperature bias in the stratosphere by up to 50\% and is implemented in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational forecasting system. Despite different origins and applications, data assimilation (DA) and Deep Learning are both able to learn about the Earth system from observations. In this paper, a deep learning approach for model bias correction is developed using temperature retrievals from radio occultation (RO) measurements. Neural networks (NNs) require a large number of samples to properly capture the relationship between the temperature first-guess trajectory and the model bias. As running the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) DA system for extended periods of time with a fixed model version and at realistic resolutions is computationally very expensive, we have chosen to train, the initial NNs are trained using the ERA5 reanalysis before using transfer learning on 1 year of the current IFS model. Preliminary results show that convolutional NNs are adequate to estimate model bias from RO temperature retrievals. The different strengths and weaknesses of both deep learning and weak constraint 4D-Var are discussed, highlighting the potential for each method to learn model biases effectively and adaptively.},

Since we expect current dynamics to be smooth but highly non-linear, Gaussian processes (GPs) offer an attractive model. But we show that applying a GP with a standard stationary kernel directly to buoy data can struggle at both current prediction and divergence identification ‚Äì due to some physically unrealistic prior assumptions. To better reflect known physical properties of currents, we propose to instead put a standard stationary kernel on the divergence and curl-free components of a vector field obtained through a Helmholtz decomposition. We show that, because this decomposition relates to the original vector field just via mixed partial derivatives, we can still perform inference given the original data with only a small constant multiple of additional computational expense. We illustrate the benefits of our method on synthetic and real oceans data.}

	abstract = {Abstract The use of machine learning to build subgrid parametrizations for climate models is receiving growing attention. State-of-the-art strategies address the problem as a supervised learning task and optimize algorithms that predict subgrid fluxes based on information from coarse resolution models. In practice, training data are generated from higher resolution numerical simulations transformed in order to mimic coarse resolution simulations. By essence, these strategies optimize subgrid parametrizations to meet so-called a priori criteria. But the actual purpose of a subgrid parametrization is to obtain good performance in terms of a posteriori metrics which imply computing entire model trajectories. In this paper, we focus on the representation of energy backscatter in two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence and compare parametrizations obtained with different learning strategies at fixed computational complexity. We show that strategies based on a priori criteria yield parametrizations that tend to be unstable in direct simulations and describe how subgrid parametrizations can alternatively be trained end-to-end in order to meet a posteriori criteria. We illustrate that end-to-end learning strategies yield parametrizations that outperform known empirical and data-driven schemes in terms of performance, stability, and ability to apply to different flow configurations. These results support the relevance of differentiable programming paradigms for climate models in the future.},

@article{OCEANCARBONCYCLE,
	abstract = { The ocean holds vast quantities of carbon that it continually exchanges with the atmosphere through the air-sea interface. Because of its enormous size and relatively rapid exchange of carbon with the atmosphere, the ocean controls atmospheric CO2 concentration and thereby Earth's climate on timescales of tens to thousands of years. This review examines the basic functions of the ocean's carbon cycle, demonstrating that the ocean carbon inventory is determined primarily by the mass of the ocean, by the chemical speciation of CO2 in seawater, and by the action of the solubility and biological pumps that draw carbon into the ocean's deeper layers, where it can be sequestered for decades to millennia. The ocean also plays a critical role in moderating the impacts of climate change by absorbing an amount of carbon equivalent to about 25\% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the past several decades. However, this also leads to ocean acidification and reduces the chemical buffering capacity of the ocean and its future ability to take up CO2. This review closes with a look at the uncertain future of the ocean carbon cycle and the scientific challenges that this uncertainty brings. },

Ocean colour data also have a critical role in operational observation systems monitoring coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and sediment plumes. The contiguous ocean-colour record reached 21 years in 2018; however, it is comprised of a number of one-off missions such that creating a consistent time-series of ocean-colour data requires merging of the individual sensors (including MERIS, Aqua-MODIS, SeaWiFS, VIIRS, and OLCI) with differing sensor characteristics, without introducing artefacts. By contrast, the next decade will see consistent observations from operational ocean colour series with sensors of similar design and with a replacement strategy. Also, by 2029 the record will start to be of sufficient duration to discriminate climate change impacts from natural variability, at least in some regions. This paper describes the current status and future prospects in the field of ocean colour focusing on large to medium resolution observations of oceans and coastal seas. It reviews the user requirements in terms of products and uncertainty characteristics and then describes features of current and future satellite ocean-colour sensors, both operational and innovative. The key role of in situ validation and calibration is highlighted as are ground segments that process the data received from the ocean-colour sensors and deliver analysis-ready products to end-users. Example applications of the ocean-colour data are presented, focusing on the climate data record and operational applications including water quality and assimilation into numerical models. Current capacity building and training activities pertinent to ocean colour are described and finally a summary of future perspectives is provided.},

@article{OCEANSATELLITESST,
	abstract = {Sea-surface temperature (SST) was one of the first ocean variables to be studied from earth observation satellites. Pioneering images from infrared scanning radiometers revealed the complexity of the surface temperature fields, but these were derived from radiance measurements at orbital heights and included the effects of the intervening atmosphere. Corrections for the effects of the atmosphere to make quantitative estimates of the SST became possible when radiometers with multiple infrared channels were deployed in 1979. At the same time, imaging microwave radiometers with SST capabilities were also flown. Since then, SST has been derived from infrared and microwave radiometers on polar orbiting satellites and from infrared radiometers on geostationary spacecraft. As the performances of satellite radiometers and SST retrieval algorithms improved, accurate, global, high resolution, frequently sampled SST fields became fundamental to many research and operational activities. Here we provide an overview of the physics of the derivation of SST and the history of the development of satellite instruments over half a century. As demonstrated accuracies increased, they stimulated scientific research into the oceans, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system and the climate. We provide brief overviews of the development of some applications, including the feasibility of generating Climate Data Records. We summarize the important role of the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) in providing a forum for scientists and operational practitioners to discuss problems and results, and to help coordinate activities world-wide, including alignment of data formatting and protocols and research. The challenges of burgeoning data volumes, data distribution and analysis have benefited from simultaneous progress in computing power, high capacity storage, and communications over the Internet, so we summarize the development and current capabilities of data archives. We conclude with an outlook of developments anticipated in the next decade or so.},

	abstract = {We commonly refer to state estimation theory in geosciences as data assimilation (DA). This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. DA is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean, and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of DA, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems, and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences, an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of DA being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of DA and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities. This article is categorized under: Climate Models and Modeling > Knowledge Generation with Models},

@article{OKUBO,
	abstract = {A singular point in a two-dimensional velocity field is a stationary point of flow. The simplest and most important singularities in oceanography are points of convergence (or divergence), neutral points, and lines of convergence (or divergence). In the neighbourhood of the singularity, the velocity field is approximated linearly in terms of coordinates whose origin is taken at the singularity. The linear velocity field thus considered consists of the rates of stretching deformation and shearing deformation, vorticity, and divergence (or negative convergence). A group of foreign particles initially arranged in a circle surrounding a singularity will be deformed into an ellipse the area of which increases or decreases with time depending on the sign of the divergence. When a random motion is superposed upon the velocity field, a group of particles will be subject to advection-diffusion. As a result of the combined action of the rates of stretching and shearing, vorticity, and random motion, the group size tends to grow against a collecting power of convergence toward the singularity. Asymptotically a stationary situation may be established in which a group of particles attains a certain limiting size. Only the theoretical aspect is considered.},

	abstract = {The Okubo (1970 Deep Sea Res.  17 445)--Weiss (1991 Physica D 48 273) criterion, has been extensively used as a diagnostic tool to divide a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamical flow field into hyperbolic and elliptic regions and to serve as a useful qualitative guide to the complex quantitative criteria. The Okubo--Weiss criterion is frequently validated on empirical grounds by the results ensuing its application. So, we will explore topological implications into the Okubo--Weiss criterion and show the Okubo--Weiss parameter is, to within a positive multiplicative factor, the negative of the Gaussian curvature of the vorticity manifold. The Okubo--Weiss criterion is then reformulated in polar coordinates, and is validated for several examples including the Lamb--Oseen vortex, and the Burgers vortex. These developments are then extended to 2D quasi-geostrophic (QG) flows. The Okubo--Weiss parameter is shown to remain robust under the Œ≤-plane approximation to the Coriolis parameter. The Okubo--Weiss criterion is shown to be able to separate the 2D flow-field into coherent elliptic structures and hyperbolic flow configurations very well via numerical simulations of quasi-stationary vortices in QG flows. An Okubo--Weiss type criterion is formulate for 3D axisymmetric slows, and is validated via application to the round Landau--Squire Laminar jet flow.},

@article{OCEANEddyTracking,
	abstract = {High-resolution ocean general circulation models have advanced the numerical study of ocean eddies. To gain an understanding of ocean eddies from the large volume of data produced by simulations, visualizing just the distribution of eddies at each time step is insufficient; time- variations in eddy events and phenomena must also be considered. However, existing methods cannot accurately detect and track eddy events such as amalgamation and bifurcation. In this study, we propose a new approach for eddy detection, tracking, and event visualization based on an eddy classification system. The proposed method detects streams and currents in addition to eddies, and it classifies detected eddies into several categories using the additional stream and current information. By tracking how the classified eddies vary over time, it is possible to detect events such as eddy amalgamation and bifurcation as well as the interaction between eddies and ocean currents. We visualize the detected eddies and events in a time series of images (or animation), enabling us to gain an intuitive understanding of a region of interest hidden in a high-resolution data set.},

@article{OCNHEALTH,
	abstract = {The Antarctic coast and seas are considered some of the most pristine marine systems on Earth. Their comprehensive assessment is critical because meeting ambitious conservation objectives while maintaining sustainable human uses will be increasingly challenging with growing climate change impacts, recovery from past overharvesting, and potential revision of activities permitted with future revisions of the existing governance structure. We used the Ocean Health Index (OHI) to deliver an integrated assessment of the Antarctic marine ecosystems' evolving ecological and social dimensions. The OHI provides a framework to evaluate sustainable delivery of benefits people want from healthy oceans by measuring progress toward 10 widely-held societal goals. These goals include, conservation objectives, as well as other objectives, so as to identify tradeoffs across multiple priorities. We adapted the Index to the unique aspects and data availability of Antarctica. OHI scores were calculated for each sub-region defined by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) as well as the region overall. OHI scores for conservation-related goals (biodiversity, clean water) were generally high, though with some stressor impacts (i.e., climate-driven decline of sea-ice, and pathogen pollution). However, a sensitivity test on the sea-ice habitat indicator showed biodiversity scores might be much lower in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula. Preservation of lasting special places, captured in the sense of place sub-goal, scored relatively low due to limited extent of Marine Protected Areas in the Southern Ocean. In several cases, scores are low due to under-utilization of resources, rather than environmentally unsustainable practices (e.g., food provision, natural products, tourism, and recreation). However, increased human activities would intensify the risk of pollution, pathogen contamination, and disturbance to wildlife, particularly if compounded with future climate change impacts. Therefore, scores may reflect the need to select more conservative targets for human use, articulated in international treaties, taking future risks into account. Our results highlight the need for more research on both natural and social science aspects of the Antarctic system, as well as the need to evaluate targets under different scenarios, so as to provide robust science-based advice for future decision-making in the region.},

	abstract = {Protecting the ocean has become a major goal of international policy as human activities increasingly endanger the integrity of the ocean ecosystem, often summarized as ``ocean health.'' By and large, efforts to protect the ocean have failed because, among other things, (1) the underlying socio-ecological pathways have not been properly considered, and (2) the concept of ocean health has been ill defined. Collectively, this prevents an adequate societal response as to how ocean ecosystems and their vital functions for human societies can be protected and restored. We review the confusion surrounding the term ``ocean health'' and suggest an operational ocean-health framework in line with the concept of strong sustainability. Given the accelerating degeneration of marine ecosystems, the restoration of regional ocean health will be of increasing importance. Our advocated transdisciplinary and multi-actor framework can help to advance the implementation of more active measures to restore ocean health and safeguard human health and well-being.},

	abstract = {The paper provides a review of recent results on mesoscale ocean dynamics derived from satellite altimetry. Since 1992, we have had an unprecedented 18year high-resolution monitoring of the ocean mesoscale field. Altimetry is often used in mesoscale studies in synergy with other remote sensing techniques and in situ data. This global, high-resolution data set has allowed oceanographers to quantify the previously unknown seasonal and interannual variations in eddy kinetic energy and eddy heat and salt transports, and investigate their causes. Eddy tracking techniques have allowed us to monitor their propagation pathways, to bring to light the meridional divergence of cyclones and anticyclones, and to question the role of Rossby waves versus non-linear eddies in the mid to high latitude bands. Altimetry has also revealed the presence of zonal fronts and jets everywhere in the ocean, and brought to light how mesoscale eddies can impact back onto the atmospheric circulation. Finally, altimetry, in synergy with other observations and high-resolution numerical models, has helped reveal the complexity of the sub-mesoscale features, associated with stirring and mixing around the mesoscale eddies, of great importance for the vertical exchange of oceanic tracers. Altimetry has revealed the complexity of the mesoscale system{\ldots} the scientific community is now working to understand the interplay between these mesoscale eddies, the ocean interior and its impact on the overlying atmosphere.},

@article{SSHMESOSCALE2,
	abstract = {Sixteen years of sea-surface height (SSH) fields constructed by merging the measurements from two simultaneously operating altimeters are analyzed to investigate mesoscale variability in the global ocean. The prevalence of coherent mesoscale features (referred to here as ``eddies'') with radius scales of O(100km) is readily apparent in these high-resolution SSH fields. An automated procedure for identifying and tracking mesoscale features based on their SSH signatures yields 35,891 eddies with lifetimes ‚©æ16weeks. These long-lived eddies, comprising approximately 1.15 million individual eddy observations, have an average lifetime of 32weeks and an average propagation distance of 550km. Their mean amplitude and a speed-based radius scale as defined by the automated procedure are 8cm and 90km, respectively. The tracked eddies are found to originate nearly everywhere in the World Ocean, consistent with previous conclusions that virtually all of the World Ocean is baroclinically unstable. Overall, there is a slight preference for cyclonic eddies. However, there is a preference for the eddies with long lifetimes and large propagation distances to be anticyclonic. In the southern hemisphere, the distributions of the amplitudes and rotational speeds of eddies are more skewed toward large values for cyclonic eddies than for anticyclonic eddies. As a result, eddies with amplitudes >10cm and rotational speeds >20cms‚àí1 are preferentially cyclonic in the southern hemisphere. By contrast, there is a slight preference for anticyclonic eddies for nearly all amplitudes and rotational speeds in the northern hemisphere. On average, there is no evidence of anisotropy of these eddies. Their average shape is well represented as Gaussian within the central 2/3 of the eddy, but the implied radius of maximum rotational speed is 64\% smaller than the observed radius of maximum speed. In part because of this mismatch between the radii of maximum axial speed in the observations and the Gaussian approximation, a case is made that a quadratic function that is a very close approximation of the mode profile of the eddy (i.e., the most frequently occurring value at each radius) is a better representation of the composite shape of the eddies. This would imply that the relative vorticity is nearly constant within the interiors of most eddies, i.e., the fluid motion consists approximately of solid-body rotation. Perhaps the most significant conclusion of this study is that essentially all of the observed mesoscale features outside of the tropical band 20$\,^{\circ}$S--20$\,^{\circ}$N are nonlinear by the metric U/c, where U is the maximum circum-average geostrophic speed within the eddy interior and c is the translation speed of the eddy. A value of U/c>1 implies that there is trapped fluid within the eddy interior. Many of the extratropical eddies are highly nonlinear, with 48\% having U/c>5 and 21\% having U/c>10. Even in the tropics, approximately 90\% of the observed mesoscale features are nonlinear by this measure. Two other nondimensional parameters also indicate strong degrees of nonlinearity in the tracked eddies. The distributions of all three measures of nonlinearity are more skewed toward large values for cyclonic eddies than for anticyclonic eddies in the southern hemisphere extratropics but the opposite is found in the northern hemisphere extratropics. There is thus a preference for highly nonlinear extratropical eddies to be cyclonic in the southern hemisphere but anticyclonic in the northern hemisphere. Further evidence in support of the interpretation of the observed features as nonlinear eddies is the fact that they propagate nearly due west with small opposing meridional deflections of cyclones and anticyclones (poleward and equatorward, respectively) and with propagation speeds that are nearly equal to the long baroclinic Rossby wave phase speed. These characteristics are consistent with theoretical expectations for large, nonlinear eddies. While there is no apparent dependence of propagation speed on eddy polarity, the eddy speeds relative to the local long Rossby wave phase speeds are found to be about 20\% faster in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere. The distributions of the propagation directions of cyclones and anticyclones are essentially the same, except mirrored about a central azimuth angle of about 1.5$\,^{\circ}$ equatorward. This small, but we believe statistically significant, equatorward rotation of the central azimuth may be evidence of the effects of ambient currents (meridional advection or the effects of vertical shear on the potential vorticity gradient vector) on the propagation directions of the eddies. While the results presented here are persuasive evidence that most of the observed westward-propagating SSH variability consists of isolated nonlinear mesoscale eddies, it is shown that the eddy propagation speeds are about 25\% slower than the westward propagation speeds of features in the SSH field that have scales larger than those of the tracked eddies. This scale dependence of the propagation speed may be evidence for the existence of dispersion and the presence of features that obey linear Rossby wave dynamics and have larger scales and faster propagation speeds than the nonlinear eddies. The amplitudes of these larger-scale signals are evidently smaller than those of the mesoscale eddy field since they are not easily isolated from the energetic nonlinear eddies.},

In areas of intense variability, the rms differences between a classical configuration of two altimeters and the scenario merging four missions can reach 10 cm and 400 cm2/s2 in SLA and EKE, respectively, which represents an important percentage of the signal variance. A comparison with surface drifters shows that the four altimeter scenario improves the recovery of mesoscale structures that were not properly sampled with Jason-1 + ERS-2/ENVISAT. Finally, the consistency between altimetric and tide gauge data is improved by about 25\% when coastal sea level is estimated with 4 satellites compared to the results obtained with 2 altimeters.},

@article{SSH3DCIRCULATION,
	abstract = {A new estimate of the Global Ocean 3D geostrophic circulation from the surface down to 1500m depth (Surcouf3D) has been computed for the 1993--2008 period using an observation-based approach that combines altimetry with temperature and salinity through the thermal wind equation. The validity of this simple approach was tested using a consistent dataset from a model reanalysis. Away from the boundary layers, errors are less than 10\% in most places, which indicate that the thermal wind equation is a robust approximation to reconstruct the 3D oceanic circulation in the ocean interior. The Surcouf3D current field was validated in the Atlantic Ocean against in-situ observations. We considered the ANDRO current velocities deduced at 1000m depth from Argo float displacements as well as velocity measurements at 26.5$\,^{\circ}$N from the RAPID-MOCHA current meter array. The Surcouf3D currents show similar skill to the 3D velocities from the GLORYS Mercator Ocean reanalysis in reproducing the amplitude and variability of the ANDRO currents. In the upper 1000m, high correlations are also found with in-situ velocities measured by the RAPID-MOCHA current meters. The Surcouf3D current field was then used to compute estimates of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) through the 25$\,^{\circ}$N section, showing good comparisons with hydrographic sections from 1998 and 2004. Monthly averaged AMOC time series are also consistent with the RAPID-MOCHA array and with the GLORYS Mercator Ocean reanalysis over the April 2004--September 2007 period. Finally a 15 years long time series of monthly estimates of the AMOC was computed. The AMOC strength has a mean value of 16Sv with an annual (resp. monthly) standard deviation of 2.4Sv (resp. 7.1Sv) over the 1993--2008 period. The time series, characterized by a strong variability, shows no significant trend.},

@article{NEMOAJAYI2020,
	abstract = {Abstract Ocean circulation is dominated by turbulent geostrophic eddy fields with typical scales ranging from 10 to 300 km. At mesoscales (>50 km), the size of eddy structures varies regionally following the Rossby radius of deformation. The variability of the scale of smaller eddies is not well known due to the limitations in existing numerical simulations and satellite capability. Nevertheless, it is well established that oceanic flows (<50 km) generally exhibit strong seasonality. In this study, we present a basin-scale analysis of coherent structures down to 10‚Äâkm in the North Atlantic Ocean using two submesoscale-permitting ocean models, a NEMO-based North Atlantic simulation with a horizontal resolution of 1/60 (NATL60) and an HYCOM-based Atlantic simulation with a horizontal resolution of 1/50 (HYCOM50). We investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the scale of eddy structures with a particular focus on eddies with scales of 10 to 100‚Äâkm, and examine the impact of the seasonality of submesoscale energy on the seasonality and distribution of coherent structures in the North Atlantic. Our results show an overall good agreement between the two models in terms of surface wave number spectra and seasonal variability. The key findings of the paper are that (i) the mean size of ocean eddies show strong seasonality; (ii) this seasonality is associated with an increased population of submesoscale eddies (10--50‚Äâkm) in winter; and (iii) the net release of available potential energy associated with mixed layer instability is responsible for the emergence of the increased population of submesoscale eddies in wintertime.},

@article{weatherbench,
	abstract = {Abstract Data-driven approaches, most prominently deep learning, have become powerful tools for prediction in many domains. A natural question to ask is whether data-driven methods could also be used to predict global weather patterns days in advance. First studies show promise but the lack of a common data set and evaluation metrics make intercomparison between studies difficult. Here we present a benchmark data set for data-driven medium-range weather forecasting (specifically 3--5‚Äâdays), a topic of high scientific interest for atmospheric and computer scientists alike. We provide data derived from the ERA5 archive that has been processed to facilitate the use in machine learning models. We propose simple and clear evaluation metrics which will enable a direct comparison between different methods. Further, we provide baseline scores from simple linear regression techniques, deep learning models, as well as purely physical forecasting models. The data set is publicly available at https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench and the companion code is reproducible with tutorials for getting started. We hope that this data set will accelerate research in data-driven weather forecasting.},

@article{ClimateBench,
	abstract = {Abstract Many different emission pathways exist that are compatible with the Paris climate agreement, and many more are possible that miss that target. While some of the most complex Earth System Models have simulated a small selection of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, it is impractical to use these expensive models to fully explore the space of possibilities. Such explorations therefore mostly rely on one-dimensional impulse response models, or simple pattern scaling approaches to approximate the physical climate response to a given scenario. Here we present ClimateBench---the first benchmarking framework based on a suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, AerChemMIP and Detection-Attribution Model Intercomparison Project simulations performed by a full complexity Earth System Model, and a set of baseline machine learning models that emulate its response to a variety of forcers. These emulators can predict annual mean global distributions of temperature, diurnal temperature range and precipitation (including extreme precipitation) given a wide range of emissions and concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and aerosols, allowing them to efficiently probe previously unexplored scenarios. We discuss the accuracy and interpretability of these emulators and consider their robustness to physical constraints such as total energy conservation. Future opportunities incorporating such physical constraints directly in the machine learning models and using the emulators for detection and attribution studies are also discussed. This opens a wide range of opportunities to improve prediction, robustness and mathematical tractability. We hope that by laying out the principles of climate model emulation with clear examples and metrics we encourage engagement from statisticians and machine learning specialists keen to tackle this important and demanding challenge.},

@article{MIOST,
	abstract = {Abstract Two methods for the mapping of ocean surface currents from satellite measurements of sea level and future current vectors are presented and contrasted. Both methods rely on the linear and Gaussian analysis framework with different levels of covariance definitions. The first method separately maps sea level and currents with single-scale covariance functions and leads to estimates of the geostrophic and ageostrophic circulations. The second maps both measurements simultaneously and projects the circulation onto four contributions: geostrophic, ageostrophic rotary, ageostrophic divergent, and inertial. When compared to the first method, the second mapping moderately improves the resolution of geostrophic currents but significantly improves estimates of the ageostrophic circulation, in particular near-inertial oscillations. This method offers promising perspectives for reconstructions of the ocean surface circulation. Even the hourly dynamics can be reconstructed from measurements made locally every few days because nearby measurements are coherent enough to help fill the gaps. Based on numerical simulation of ocean surface currents, the proposed SKIM mission that combines a nadir altimeter and a Doppler scatterometer with a 300 km wide swath (with a mean revisit time of 3 days) would allow the reconstruction of 50\% of the near-inertial variance around an 18 h period of oscillation.},

@article{Altimetry,
	abstract = {In 2018 we celebrated 25 years of development of radar altimetry, and the progress achieved by this methodology in the fields of global and coastal oceanography, hydrology, geodesy and cryospheric sciences. Many symbolic major events have celebrated these developments, e.g., in Venice, Italy, the 15th (2006) and 20th (2012) years of progress and more recently, in 2018, in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 25 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry. On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and for hydrology. The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the ``Green'' Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments' development and satellite missions' evolutions are described in a fourth section. A fifth section covers the key observations that altimeters provide and their potential complements, from other Earth observation measurements to in situ data. Section 6 identifies the data and methods and provides some accuracy and resolution requirements for the wet tropospheric correction, the orbit and other geodetic requirements, the Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Mean Dynamic Topography, Calibration and Validation, data accuracy, data access and handling (including the DUACS system). Section 7 brings a transversal view on scales, integration, artificial intelligence, and capacity building (education and training). Section 8 reviews the programmatic issues followed by a conclusion.},

@article{GLORYS12,
	abstract = {GLORYS12 is a global eddy-resolving physical ocean and sea ice reanalysis at 1/12$\,^{\circ}$ horizontal resolution covering the 1993-present altimetry period, designed and implemented in the framework of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The model component is the NEMO platform driven at the surface by atmospheric conditions from the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. Ocean observations are assimilated by means of a reduced-order Kalman filter. Along track altimeter sea level anomaly, satellite sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration, as well as in situ temperature and salinity vertical profiles are jointly assimilated. A 3D-VAR scheme provides an additional correction for the slowly-evolving large-scale biases in temperature and salinity. The performance of the reanalysis shows a clear dependency on the time-dependent in situ observation system. The general assessment of GLORYS12 highlights a level of performance at the state-of-the-art and the capacity of the system to capture the main expected climatic interannual variability signals for ocean and sea ice, the general circulation and the inter-basins exchanges. In terms of trends, GLORYS12 shows a higher than observed warming trend together with a slightly lower than observed global mean sea level rise. Comparisons made with an experiment carried out on the same platform without assimilation show the benefit of data assimilation in controlling water mass properties and sea ice cover and their low frequency variability. Moreover, GLORYS12 represents particularly well the small-scale variability of surface dynamics and compares well with independent (non-assimilated) data. Comparisons made with a twin experiment carried out at 1/4$\,^{\circ}$ resolution allows characterizing and quantifying the strengthened contribution of the 1/12$\,^{\circ}$ resolution onto the downscaled dynamics. GLORYS12 provides a reliable physical ocean state for climate variability and supports applications such as seasonal forecasts. In addition, this reanalysis has strong assets to serve regional applications and provide relevant physical conditions for applications such as marine biogeochemistry. In the near future, GLORYS12 will be maintained to be as close as possible to real time and could therefore provide relevant and continuous reference past ocean states for many operational applications.},
