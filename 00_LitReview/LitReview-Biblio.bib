  abstract = {For more than 20 years, the multi-satellite Data Unification and Altimeter Combination System (DUACS) has been providing near-real-time (NRT) and delayed-time (DT) altimetry products. DUACS datasets range from along-track measurements to multi-mission sea level anomaly (SLA) and absolute dynamic topography (ADT) maps. The DUACS DT2018 ensemble of products is the most recent and major release. For this, 25 years of altimeter data have been reprocessed and are available through the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Several changes were implemented in DT2018 processing in order to improve the product quality. New altimetry standards and geophysical corrections were used, data selection was refined and optimal interpolation (OI) parameters were reviewed for global and regional map generation.  This paper describes the extensive assessment of DT2018 reprocessing. The error budget associated with DT2018 products at global and regional scales was defined and improvements on the previous version were quantified (DT2014; Pujol et al., 2016). DT2018 mesoscale errors were estimated using independent and in situ measurements. They have been reduced by nearly 3\&thinsp;\% to 4\&thinsp;\% for global and regional products compared to DT2014. This reduction is even greater in coastal areas (up to 10\&thinsp;\%) where it is directly linked to the geophysical corrections applied to DT2018 processing. The conclusions are very similar concerning geostrophic currents, for which error was globally reduced by around 5\&thinsp;\% and as much as 10\&thinsp;\% in coastal areas.},

  abstract = {Abstract During the past 25 years, altimetric observations of the ocean surface from space have been mapped to provide two dimensional sea surface height (SSH) fields that are crucial for scientific research and operational applications. The SSH fields can be reconstructed from conventional altimetric data using temporal and spatial interpolation. For instance, the standard Developing Use of Altimetry for Climate Studies (DUACS) products are created with an optimal interpolation method that is effective for both low temporal and low spatial resolution. However, the upcoming next-generation SWOT mission will provide very high spatial resolution but with low temporal resolution. The present paper makes the case that this temporal\textendash spatial discrepancy induces the need for new advanced mapping techniques involving information on the ocean dynamics. An algorithm is introduced, dubbed the BFN-QG, that uses a simple data assimilation method, the back-and-forth nudging (BNF), to interpolate altimetric data while respecting quasigeostrophic (QG) dynamics. The BFN-QG is tested in an observing system simulation experiments and compared to the DUACS products. The experiments consider as reference the high-resolution numerical model simulation NATL60 from which are produced realistic data: four conventional altimetric nadirs and SWOT data. In a combined nadirs and SWOT scenario, the BFN-QG substantially improves the mapping by reducing the root-mean-square errors and increasing the spectral effective resolution by 40 km. Also, the BFN-QG method can be adapted to combine large-scale corrections from nadir data and small-scale corrections from SWOT data so as to reduce the impact of SWOT correlated noises and still provide accurate SSH maps.},

The model component is the NEMO platform driven at the surface by atmospheric conditions from the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. Ocean observations are assimilated by means of a reduced-order Kalman filter. Along track altimeter sea level anomaly, satellite sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration, as well as in situ temperature and salinity vertical profiles are jointly assimilated. A 3D-VAR scheme provides an additional correction for the slowly-evolving large-scale biases in temperature and salinity. The performance of the reanalysis shows a clear dependency on the timedependent in situ observation system. The general assessment of GLORYS12 highlights a level of performance at the state-of-the-art and the capacity of the system to capture the main expected climatic interannual variability signals for ocean and sea ice, the general circulation and the inter-basins exchanges. In terms of trends, GLORYS12 shows a higher than observed warming trend together with a slightly lower than observed global mean sea level rise. Comparisons made with an experiment carried out on the same platform without assimilation show the benefit of data assimilation in controlling water mass properties and sea ice cover and their low frequency variability. Moreover, GLORYS12 represents particularly well the small-scale variability of surface dynamics and compares well with independent (non-assimilated) data. Comparisons made with a twin experiment carried out at 1/4\textdegree{} resolution allows characterizing and quantifying the strengthened contribution of the 1/12\textdegree{} resolution onto the downscaled dynamics. GLORYS12 provides a reliable physical ocean state for climate variability and supports applications such as seasonal forecasts...},

The present study proposes a new method to address these challenges. Based on the conservation of potential vorticity, the method provides a simple dynamic approach to interpolation through temporal gaps between high spatial resolution observations. For gaps shorter than 20 days, the dynamic interpolation is extremely efficient and allows for the reconstruction of the time evolution of small mesoscale eddies (below 100 km) that would be smoothed out by conventional methods based on optimal mapping. Such a simple approach offers some perspectives for developing high-level products from high-resolution altimetry data in the future.},

  abstract = {Abstract The dynamic optimal interpolation (DOI) method merges altimetric sea surface height (SSH) data into maps that are continuous in time and space. Unlike the traditional linear optimal interpolation (LOI) method, DOI has the advantage of considering a nonlinear temporal propagation of the SSH field. DOI has been successfully applied to along-track pseudo-observations in observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs), demonstrating a reduction in interpolation error in highly turbulent regions compared to LOI mapping. In the present study, we further extend the validation of the DOI method by an observing system experiment (OSE). We applied and validated the DOI approach with real nadir-altimetric observations in four regional configurations. Overall, the qualitative and quantitative assessments of these realistic SSH maps confirm the higher level of performance of the DOI approach in turbulent regions. It is more of a challenge to outperform the conventional LOI mapping in coastal and low-energy regions. Validations against LOI maps distributed by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service indicate a 10\%\textendash 15\% increase in average performance and an improved resolution limit toward shorter wavelengths. The DOI method also shows improved mesoscale mapping of intense jets and fronts and reveals new eddies with smoother trajectories.},

  abstract = {The reconstruction of sea surface currents from satellite altimeter data is a key challenge in spatial oceanography, especially with the upcoming wide-swath SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean and Topography) altimeter mission. Operational systems, however, generally fail to retrieve mesoscale dynamics for horizontal scales below 100 km and timescales below 10 d. Here, we address this challenge through the 4DVarnet framework, an end-to-end neural scheme backed on a variational data assimilation formulation. We introduce a parameterization of the 4DVarNet scheme dedicated to the space\textendash time interpolation of satellite altimeter data. Within an observing system simulation experiment (NATL60), we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach, both for nadir and nadir plus SWOT altimeter configurations for two contrasting case study regions in terms of upper ocean dynamics. We report a relative improvement with respect to the operational optimal interpolation between 30 \% and 60 \% in terms of the reconstruction error. Interestingly, for the nadir plus SWOT altimeter configuration, we reach resolved space\textendash timescales below 70 km and 7 d. The code is open source to enable reproducibility and future collaborative developments. Beyond its applicability to large-scale domains, we also address the uncertainty quantification issues and generalization properties of the proposed learning setting. We discuss further future research avenues and extensions to other ocean data assimilation and space oceanography challenges.},

The particularity of this approach is to mitigate the potential aliasing effects between mesoscales and internal tide estimation from the uneven altimetry sampling (observing the sum of these components) by accounting for their statistics simultaneously, while other methods generally use a prior mesoscale. The four major tidal components are considered (M2, K1, S2, O1) over the period 1992\textendash 2017 on a global configuration. From the solution, we use altimetry data after 2017 for independent validation in order to evaluate the performance of the simultaneous inversion and compare it with an existing model.},

  abstract = {Two methods for the mapping of ocean surface currents from satellite measurements of sea level and future current vectors are presented and contrasted. Both methods rely on the linear and Gaussian analysis framework with different levels of covariance definitions. The first method separately maps sea level and currents with single-scale covariance functions and leads to estimates of the geostrophic and ageostrophic circulations. The second maps both measurements simultaneously and projects the circulation onto four contributions: geostrophic, ageostrophic rotary, ageostrophic divergent, and inertial. When compared to the first method, the second mapping moderately improves the resolution of geostrophic currents but significantly improves estimates of the ageostrophic circulation, in particular near-inertial oscillations. This method offers promising perspectives for reconstructions of the ocean surface circulation. Even the hourly dynamics can be reconstructed from measurements made locally every few days because nearby measurements are coherent enough to help fill the gaps. Based on numerical simulation of ocean surface currents, the proposed SKIM mission that combines a nadir altimeter and a Doppler scatterometer with a 300 km wide swath (with a mean revisit time of 3 days) would allow the reconstruction of 50\% of the near-inertial variance around an 18 h period of oscillation.},

This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. DA is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean, and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of DA, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems, and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences, an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of DA being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of DA and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.

With the influx of more satellite missions, we have access to more and more observations and it is becoming more pertinent to take advantage of these observations in applications such as forecasting and reanalysis. With the increase of the volume of available data, scalability remains an issue for standard OI and it prevents many practitioners from effectively and efficiently taking advantage of these large sums of data to learn the model hyperparameters. In this work, we leverage recent advances in Neural Fields (NerFs) as an alternative to the OI framework where we show how they can be easily applied to standard reconstruction problems in physical oceanography. We illustrate the relevance of NerFs for gap-filling of sparse measurements of sea surface height (SSH) via satellite altimetry and demonstrate how NerFs are scalable with comparable results to the standard OI. We find that NerFs are a practical set of methods that can be readily applied to geoscience interpolation problems and we anticipate a wider adoption in the future.},

Considering that mesoscale SSH patterns can evolve on timescales comparable to or shorter than satellite return periods, it is challenging to accurately reconstruct the continuous SSH evolution as currently available altimetry observations are still spatially and temporally sparse. Here we explore the possibility of SSH interpolation via Deep Learning by using synthetic observations from an idealized quasigeostrophic model of baroclinic ocean turbulence. We demonstrate that Convolutional Neural Networks with Residual Learning are superior in SSH reconstruction to linear and recently developed dynamical interpolation techniques. Also, the deep neural networks can provide a skillful state estimate of unobserved deep ocean currents at mesoscales. These conspicuous results suggest that SSH patterns of eddies might contain substantial information about the underlying deep ocean currents that are necessary for SSH prediction. Our training data are focused on highly idealized physics and diversification of processes needs to be considered to more accurately represent the real ocean. In addition, methodological improvements such as transfer learning and implementation of dynamically aware loss functions might be necessary to consider before its ultimate use with real satellite observations. Nonetheless, by providing a proof of concept based on synthetic data, our results point to deep learning as a viable alternative to existing interpolation and, more generally, state estimation methods for satellite observations of eddying currents.},

In this paper, we investigate how they might help to solve for the oversmoothing of the state-of-the-art optimal interpolation (OI) techniques in the reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH) spatio-temporal fields. We focus on a small region, part of the GULFSTREAM and mainly driven by energetic mesoscale dynamics. Based on an Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE), we will use the NATL60 high resolution deterministic ocean simulation of the North Atlantic to generate two types of pseudo altimetric observational dataset: along-track nadir data for the current capabilities of the observation system and wide-swath SWOT data in the context of the upcoming SWOT mission. We briefly introduce the analog data assimilation (AnDA), an up-to-date version of the DINEOF algorithm, and a new NN-based end-to-end learning framework for the representation of spatio-temporal irregulary-sampled data. We evaluate how some of these methods are a significant improvements, particularly by catching up the small scales ranging up to 30-40km, inaccessible by the conventional methods so far. A clear gain is also demonstrated when assimilating jointly wide-swath SWOT and (agreggated) along-track nadir observations.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing availability of large-scale observations and simulation datasets, data-driven representations arise as efficient and relevant computation representations of geophysical systems for a wide range of applications, where model-driven models based on ordinary differential equations remain the state-of-the-art approaches. In this work, we investigate neural networks (NN) as physically-sound data-driven representations of such systems. Viewing Runge-Kutta methods as graphical models, we consider a residual NN architecture and introduce bilinear layers to embed non-linearities which are intrinsic features of geophysical systems. From numerical experiments for synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed NN-based architecture both in terms of forecasting performance and model identification.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses physics-informed deep learning schemes for satellite ocean remote sensing data. Such observation datasets are characterized by the irregular space-time sampling of the ocean surface due to sensors' characteristics and satellite orbits. With a focus on satellite altimetry, we show that end-to-end learning schemes based on variational formulations provide new means to explore and exploit such observation datasets. Through Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) using numerical ocean simulations and real nadir and wide-swath altimeter sampling patterns, we demonstrate their relevance w.r.t. state-of-the-art and operational methods for space-time interpolation and short-term forecasting issues. We also stress and discuss how they could contribute to the design and calibration of ocean observing systems.},

  abstract = {Data assimilation is a key component of operational systems and scientific studies for the understanding, modeling, forecasting and reconstruction of earth systems informed by observation data. Here, we investigate how physics-informed deep learning may provide new means to revisit data assimilation problems. We develop a so-called end-to-end learning approach, which explicitly relies on a variational data assimilation formulation. Using automatic differentiation embedded in deep learning framework, the key novelty of the proposed physics-informed approach is to allow the joint training of the representation of the dynamical process of interest as well as of the solver of the data assimilation problem. We may perform this joint training using both supervised and unsupervised strategies. Our numerical experiments on Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 systems report significant gain w.r.t. a classic gradient-based minimization of the variational cost both in terms of reconstruction performance and optimization complexity. Intriguingly, we also show that the variational models issued from the true Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 ODE representations may not lead to the best reconstruction performance. We believe these results may open new research avenues for the specification of assimilation models for earth systems, both to speed-up the inversion problem with trainable solvers but possibly more importantly in the way data assimilation systems are designed, for instance regarding the representation of geophysical dynamics.},

  abstract = {The space-time reconstruction of sea surface dynamics from satellite observations is a challenging inverse problem due to the associated irregular sampling. Satellite altimetry provides direct observation of the sea surface height (SSH), which relates to the divergence-free component of sea surface currents. The associated sampling pattern prevents operational schemes from retrieving fine-scale dynamics, typically below 10 days. By contrast, other satellite sensors provide higher-resolution observations of sea surface tracers such as sea surface temperature (SST). Multimodal inversion schemes then arise as appealing approaches. Though theoretical evidence supports the existence of an explicit relationship between SST and sea surface dynamics under specific dynamical regimes, the generalization to the variety of upper ocean dynamical regimes is complex. Here, we investigate this issue from a physics-informed learning perspective. We introduce a trainable multimodal inversion scheme for the reconstruction of sea surface dynamics from multisource satellite-derived observations, namely satellite-derived SSH and SST data. The proposed multimodal 4DVarNet schemes combine a variational formulation involving trainable observation and a priori terms with a trainable gradient-based solver. An observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) for a Gulf stream region supports the relevance of our approach compared with state-of-the-art schemes. We report a relative improvement greater than 60\% compared with the operational altimetry product in terms of root mean square error (MSE) and resolved space-time scales. We discuss further the potential and the limitations of the proposed approach for the reconstruction and forecasting of geophysical dynamics from irregularly-sampled satellite observations.},

  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},
