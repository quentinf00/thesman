    \caption{Overview of the experimental setup. On the left side we display the OSSE training principle based on an ocean simulation which will be used for 1) generating synthetic observation and 2) the training objective of the neural mapping scheme. On the right side we show the evaluation principle of splitting the available satellite observations to evaluate the method on data that were not used for the inference.}
