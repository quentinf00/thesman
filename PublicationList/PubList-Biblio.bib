  abstract = {Satellite altimetry combined with data assimilation and optimal interpolation schemes have deeply renewed our ability to monitor sea surface dynamics. Recently, deep learning (DL) schemes have emerged as appealing solutions to address space-time interpolation problems. The scarcity of real altimetry dataset, in terms of space-time coverage of the sea surface, however impedes the training of state-of-the-art neural schemes on real-world case-studies. Here, we leverage both simulations of ocean dynamics and satellite altimeters to train simulation-based neural mapping schemes for the sea surface height and demonstrate their performance for real altimetry datasets. We analyze further how the ocean simulation dataset used during the training phase impacts this performance. This experimental analysis covers both the resolution from eddy-present configurations to eddy-rich ones, forced simulations vs. reanalyses using data assimilation and tide-free vs. tide-resolving simulations. Our benchmarking framework focuses on a Gulf Stream region for a realistic 5-altimeter constellation using NEMO ocean simulations and 4DVarNet mapping schemes. All simulation-based 4DVarNets outperform the operational observation-driven and reanalysis products, namely DUACS and GLORYS. The more realistic the ocean simulation dataset used during the training phase, the better the mapping. The best 4DVarNet mapping was trained from an eddy-rich and tide-free simulation datasets. It improves the resolved longitudinal scale from 151 kilometers for DUACS and 241 kilometers for GLORYS to 98 kilometers and reduces the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 23\% and 61\%. These results open research avenues for new synergies between ocean modelling and ocean observation using learning-based approaches.},

  abstract = {The ocean profoundly influences human activities and plays a critical role in climate regulation. Our understanding has improved over the last decades with the advent of satellite remote sensing data, allowing us to capture essential quantities over the globe, e.g., sea surface height (SSH). However, ocean satellite data presents challenges for information extraction due to their sparsity and irregular sampling, signal complexity, and noise. Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated their capabilities in dealing with large-scale, complex signals. Therefore we see an opportunity for ML models to harness the information contained in ocean satellite data. However, data representation and relevant evaluation metrics can be the defining factors when determining the success of applied ML. The processing steps from the raw observation data to a ML-ready state and from model outputs to interpretable quantities require domain expertise, which can be a significant barrier to entry for ML researchers. OceanBench is a unifying framework that provides standardized processing steps that comply with domain-expert standards. It provides plug-and-play data and pre-configured pipelines for ML researchers to benchmark their models and a transparent configurable framework for researchers to customize and extend the pipeline for their tasks. In this work, we demonstrate the OceanBench framework through a first edition dedicated to SSH interpolation challenges. We provide datasets and ML-ready benchmarking pipelines for the long-standing problem of interpolating observations from simulated ocean satellite data, multi-modal and multi-sensor fusion issues, and transfer-learning to real ocean satellite observations. The OceanBench framework is available at github.com/jejjohnson/oceanbench and the dataset registry is available at github.com/quentinf00/oceanbench-data-registry.},

  abstract = {The reconstruction of sea surface currents from satellite altimeter data is a key challenge in spatial oceanography, especially with the upcoming wide-swath SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean and Topography) altimeter mission. Operational systems, however, generally fail to retrieve mesoscale dynamics for horizontal scales below 100 km and timescales below 10 d. Here, we address this challenge through the 4DVarnet framework, an end-to-end neural scheme backed on a variational data assimilation formulation. We introduce a parameterization of the 4DVarNet scheme dedicated to the space\textendash time interpolation of satellite altimeter data. Within an observing system simulation experiment (NATL60), we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach, both for nadir and nadir plus SWOT altimeter configurations for two contrasting case study regions in terms of upper ocean dynamics. We report a relative improvement with respect to the operational optimal interpolation between 30 \% and 60 \% in terms of the reconstruction error. Interestingly, for the nadir plus SWOT altimeter configuration, we reach resolved space\textendash timescales below 70 km and 7 d. The code is open source to enable reproducibility and future collaborative developments. Beyond its applicability to large-scale domains, we also address the uncertainty quantification issues and generalization properties of the proposed learning setting. We discuss further future research avenues and extensions to other ocean data assimilation and space oceanography challenges.},

  abstract = {The reconstruction of gap-free signals from observation data is a critical challenge for numerous application domains, such as geoscience and space-based earth observation, when the available sensors or the data collection processes lead to irregularly-sampled and noisy observations. Optimal interpolation (OI), also referred to as kriging, provides a theoretical framework to solve interpolation problems for Gaussian processes (GP). The associated computational complexity being rapidly intractable for n-dimensional tensors and increasing numbers of observations, a rich literature has emerged to address this issue using ensemble methods, sparse schemes or iterative approaches. Here, we introduce a neural OI scheme. It exploits a variational formulation with convolutional auto-encoders and a trainable iterative gradient-based solver. Theoretically equivalent to the OI formulation, the trainable solver asymptotically converges to the OI solution when dealing with both stationary and non-stationary linear spatio-temporal GPs. Through a bi-level optimization formulation, we relate the learning step and the selection of the training loss to the theoretical properties of the OI, which is an unbiased estimator with minimal error variance. Numerical experiments for 2d+t synthetic GP datasets demonstrate the relevance of the proposed scheme to learn computationally-efficient and scalable OI models and solvers from data. As illustrated for a real-world interpolation problems for satellite-derived geophysical dynamics, the proposed framework also extends to non-linear and multimodal interpolation problems and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation methods, when dealing with very high missing data rates.},

  abstract = {The space-time reconstruction of sea surface dynamics from satellite observations is a challenging inverse problem due to the associated irregular sampling. Satellite altimetry provides direct observation of the sea surface height (SSH), which relates to the divergence-free component of sea surface currents. The associated sampling pattern prevents operational schemes from retrieving fine-scale dynamics, typically below 10 days. By contrast, other satellite sensors provide higher-resolution observations of sea surface tracers such as sea surface temperature (SST). Multimodal inversion schemes then arise as appealing approaches. Though theoretical evidence supports the existence of an explicit relationship between SST and sea surface dynamics under specific dynamical regimes, the generalization to the variety of upper ocean dynamical regimes is complex. Here, we investigate this issue from a physics-informed learning perspective. We introduce a trainable multimodal inversion scheme for the reconstruction of sea surface dynamics from multisource satellite-derived observations, namely satellite-derived SSH and SST data. The proposed multimodal 4DVarNet schemes combine a variational formulation involving trainable observation and a priori terms with a trainable gradient-based solver. An observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) for a Gulf stream region supports the relevance of our approach compared with state-of-the-art schemes. We report a relative improvement greater than 60\% compared with the operational altimetry product in terms of root mean square error (MSE) and resolved space-time scales. We discuss further the potential and the limitations of the proposed approach for the reconstruction and forecasting of geophysical dynamics from irregularly-sampled satellite observations.},

  abstract = {Satellite radar altimeters are a key source of observation of ocean surface dynamics. However, current sensor technology and mapping techniques do not yet allow to systematically resolve scales smaller than 100km. With their new sensors, upcoming wide-swath altimeter missions such as SWOT should help resolve finer scales. Current mapping techniques rely on the quality of the input data, which is why the raw data go through multiple preprocessing stages before being used. Those calibration stages are improved and refined over many years and represent a challenge when a new type of sensor start acquiring data. Here we show how a data-driven variational data assimilation framework could be used to jointly learn a calibration operator and an interpolator from non-calibrated data . The proposed framework significantly outperforms the operational state-of-the-art mapping pipeline and truly benefits from wide-swath data to resolve finer scales on the global map as well as in the SWOT sensor geometry.},
