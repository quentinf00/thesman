\section{Problem Formulation}
\label{sec:chap1_problem_form}
We are interested in a broad class of problems that involve finding the optimal function $f$ which maps the available inputs $y$ to the desired outputs $u$.

In geoscience, $u$ and $y$ can generally be defined as $D_u$ and $D_y$ dimensional vector fields defined on spatio-temporal domains $\Omega_u$ and $\Omega_y$. Here, we consider scalar fields and discrete fields as particular cases of this generic formulation. The different problems can be characterized by the types of quantities $u$ and $y$ and the spatio-temporal domains $\Omega_u$ and $\Omega_y$ on which they are defined. Figure \ref{fig:planet_drawings} illustrates how our two use cases of sensor calibration and SSH mapping easily fit into such formulation. Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:task_ontology} shows how tasks such as calibration, mapping, and forecasting can differ through the domain of definition of $u$ and $y$.

{\footnotesize Using the perspective provided by the problem definition, we can easily categorize earth observation problems.
The calibration consist of estimating the field $u$ on a subset of the observation domain, the mapping consist in estimating $u$ on the same temporal domain but extending the spatial domain.
And finally forecast can considered as wanting to estimate a quantity on an unobserved future domain.}

\section{Method Ontology}
We aim to characterize and organize the various methods used to tackle the class of problem introduced in \ref{sec:chap1_problem_form}. We propose that all methods can be decomposed into the following two steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1: Define the set $\cal{F}$ of possible $f$ using theoretical knowledge (conceptual models)
\item Step 2: Search $\cal{F}$ for an optimal $f$ using factual knowledge (data)
\end{itemize}

To illustrate our point, consider a simple example of building a thermometer by placing a liquid in a tube and wanting to interpret the level of the liquid as a temperature. According to our previous notations, $y$ is the level of the liquid and $u$ is the temperature of the liquid inside, and we seek to find the mapping $f$ between the two.

Step 1 involves compiling our theoretical knowledge on the problem to define the class of function. Given our understanding of fluid dilation in response to temperature, under the assumption that the diameter of the tube is constant with height, we can state that the level is linearly correlated with the temperature. Therefore, $f$ will be part of $\cal{F} = { y: \alpha y + \beta , (\alpha, \beta) \in |R^2 }$.

In Step 2, to find $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we require two data points to calibrate our model, traditionally obtained by placing the thermometer in icy and boiling water at 1 bar of pressure to get the levels corresponding to 0°C and 100°C. This method relies on strong theoretical foundations and assumptions to reduce the dimensionality of the search space $\cal{F}$, thus facilitating the parameter search with relatively few data points.

However, if we clearly see that the diameter of our thermometer is not constant, the model needs to incorporate that the evolution of the temperature depends on the diameter at each height. This expands the class of functions, necessitating the incorporation of a model of the evolution of the diameter in function of the height, which will introduce new parameters. We could assume that the diameter is linear for every 5mm section, and the corresponding parameters to search would be the value of the diameter every 5mm.

To estimate these new parameters, we need more data which could be direct measures of the diameter or measures of temperature every 5mm. We could directly model $f$ as linear per part, thereby reducing the number of parameters to estimate (no more $\alpha$ and $\beta$). If we have measurements of the temperature, this also alleviates the need to explicitly model the relationship between diameter and temperature.
