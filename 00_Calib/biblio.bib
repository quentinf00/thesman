We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

However, current sensor technology and mapping techniques do not yet allow to systematically resolve scales smaller than 100km. With their new sensors, upcoming wide-swath altimeter missions such as SWOT should help resolve finer scales. Current mapping techniques rely on the quality of the input data, which is why the raw data go through multiple preprocessing stages before being used. Those calibration stages are improved and refined over many years and represent a challenge when a new type of sensor start acquiring data. Here we show how a data-driven variational data assimilation framework could be used to jointly learn a calibration operator and an interpolator from non-calibrated data . The proposed framework significantly outperforms the operational state-of-the-art mapping pipeline and truly benefits from wide-swath data to resolve finer scales on the global map as well as in the SWOT sensor geometry.}, booktitle={ICASSP 2022 - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)}, author={Febvre, Q. and Fablet, R. and Sommer, J.

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate “reasonable bounds” - linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with ResNets, Stochastic Depth networks, and DenseNets, and the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures.

While satellite altimetry provides a direct observation of the sea surface height (SSH), which relates to the divergence-free component of sea surface currents, the associated sampling pattern prevents from retrieving fine-scale sea surface dynamics, typically below a 10-day time scale. By contrast, other satellite sensors provide higher-resolution observations of sea surface tracers such as sea surface temperature (SST). Multimodal inversion schemes then arise as an appealing strategy. Though theoretical evidence supports the existence of an explicit relationship between sea surface temperature and sea surface dynamics under specific dynamical regimes, the generalization to the variety of upper ocean dynamical regimes is complex. Here, we investigate this issue from a physics-informed learning perspective. We introduce a trainable multimodal inversion scheme for the reconstruction of sea surface dynamics from multi-source satellite-derived observations. The proposed 4DVarNet schemes combine a variational formulation involving trainable observation and a priori terms with a trainable gradient-based solver. We report an application to the reconstruction of the divergence-free component of sea surface dynamics from satellite-derived SSH and SST data. An observing system simulation experiment for a Gulf Stream region supports the relevance of our approach compared with state-of-the-art schemes. We report relative improvement greater than 50% compared with the operational altimetry product in terms of root mean square error and resolved space-time scales. We discuss further the application and extension of the proposed approach for the reconstruction and forecasting of geophysical dynamics from irregularly-sampled satellite observations.}, note={arXiv:2207.01372 [physics]}, number={arXiv:2207.01372}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Fablet, Ronan and Febvre, Quentin and Chapron, Bertrand}, year={2022}, month={Jul} }

Their amplitude before calibration might be as large as tens of centimeters, i.e., able to dominate the mission error budget. To reduce their magnitude, we developed so-called data-driven (or empirical) calibration algorithms. This paper provided a summary of the overall problem, and then presented the calibration framework used for SWOT, as well as the pre-launch performance simulations. We presented two complete algorithm sequences that use ocean measurements to calibrate KaRIN globally. The simple and robust Level-2 algorithm was implemented in the ground segment to control the main source of error of SWOT’s hydrology products. In contrast, the more sophisticated Level-3 (multi-mission) algorithm was developed to improve the accuracy of ocean products, as well as the one-day orbit of the SWOT mission. The Level-2 algorithm yielded a mean inland error of 3–6 cm, i.e., a margin of 25–80% (of the signal variance) with respect to the error budget requirements. The Level-3 algorithm yielded ocean residuals of 1 cm, i.e., a variance reduction of 60–80% with respect to the Level-2 algorithm.}, number={2323}, journal={Remote Sensing}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Dibarboure, Gérald and Ubelmann, Clément and Flamant, Benjamin and Briol, Frédéric and Peral, Eva and Bracher, Geoffroy and Vergara, Oscar and Faugère, Yannice and Soulat, François and Picot, Nicolas}, year={2022}, month={Jan}, pages={6070}, language={en} }

 @article{Lindeberg_2015, title={Image Matching Using Generalized Scale-Space Interest Points}, volume={52}, ISSN={1573-7683}, DOI={10.1007/s10851-014-0541-0}, abstractNote={The performance of matching and object recognition methods based on interest points depends on both the properties of the underlying interest points and the choice of associated image descriptors. This paper demonstrates advantages of using generalized scale-space interest point detectors in this context for selecting a sparse set of points for computing image descriptors for image-based matching. For detecting interest points at any given scale, we make use of the Laplacian $$nabla ^2_{norm} L$$, the determinant of the Hessian $$det {mathcal {H}}_{norm} L$$and four new unsigned or signed Hessian feature strength measures $${mathcal {D}}_{1,norm} L$$, $$tilde{mathcal {D}}_{1,norm} L$$, $${mathcal {D}}_{2,norm} L$$and $$tilde{mathcal {D}}_{2,norm} L$$, which are defined by generalizing the definitions of the Harris and Shi-and-Tomasi operators from the second moment matrix to the Hessian matrix. Then, feature selection over different scales is performed either by scale selection from local extrema over scale of scale-normalized derivates or by linking features over scale into feature trajectories and computing a significance measure from an integrated measure of normalized feature strength over scale. A theoretical analysis is presented of the robustness of the differential entities underlying these interest points under image deformations, in terms of invariance properties under affine image deformations or approximations thereof. Disregarding the effect of the rotationally symmetric scale-space smoothing operation, the determinant of the Hessian $$det {mathcal {H}}_{norm} L$$is a truly affine covariant differential entity and the Hessian feature strength measures $${mathcal {D}}_{1,norm} L$$and $$tilde{mathcal {D}}_{1,norm} L$$have a major contribution from the affine covariant determinant of the Hessian, implying that local extrema of these differential entities will be more robust under affine image deformations than local extrema of the Laplacian operator or the Hessian feature strength measures $${mathcal {D}}_{2,norm} L$$, $$tilde{mathcal {D}}_{2,norm} L$$. It is shown how these generalized scale-space interest points allow for a higher ratio of correct matches and a lower ratio of false matches compared to previously known interest point detectors within the same class. The best results are obtained using interest points computed with scale linking and with the new Hessian feature strength measures $${mathcal {D}}_{1,norm} L$$, $$tilde{mathcal {D}}_{1,norm} L$$and the determinant of the Hessian $$det {mathcal {H}}_{norm} L$$being the differential entities that lead to the best matching performance under perspective image transformations with significant foreshortening, and better than the more commonly used Laplacian operator, its difference-of-Gaussians approximation or the Harris–Laplace operator. We propose that these generalized scale-space interest points, when accompanied by associated local scale-invariant image descriptors, should allow for better performance of interest point based methods for image-based matching, object recognition and related visual tasks.}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision}, author={Lindeberg, Tony}, year={2015}, month={May}, pages={3–36}, language={en} }

Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This “scale-space” image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation.

If a bound on ‖f(k)(.)‖∞ is given also, k≤m, then bounds on f(ζ) can be found for any ζ. A method of calculating the closest bounds is described, which is shown to be relevant to the problem of finding the interpolation formula whose error is bounded by the smallest possible multiple of ‖f(k)(.)‖∞, when ‖f(k)(.)‖∞ is unknown. This formula is identified and is called the optimal interpolation formula. The corresponding interpolating function is a spline of degree (k-1) with (m-k) knots, so it is very suitable for practical computation.},

In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. “mixing” the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. “mixing” spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models.

	abstract = {Ocean circulation is dominated by turbulent geostrophic eddy fields with typical scales ranging from 10 to 300 km. At mesoscales ({\textgreater}50 km), the size of eddy structures varies regionally following the Rossby radius of deformation. The variability of the scale of smaller eddies is not well known due to the limitations in existing numerical simulations and satellite capability. Nevertheless, it is well established that oceanic flows ({\textless}50 km) generally exhibit strong seasonality. In this study, we present a basin-scale analysis of coherent structures down to 10 km in the North Atlantic Ocean using two submesoscale-permitting ocean models, a NEMO-based North Atlantic simulation with a horizontal resolution of 1/60 (NATL60) and an HYCOM-based Atlantic simulation with a horizontal resolution of 1/50 (HYCOM50). We investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the scale of eddy structures with a particular focus on eddies with scales of 10 to 100 km, and examine the impact of the seasonality of submesoscale energy on the seasonality and distribution of coherent structures in the North Atlantic. Our results show an overall good agreement between the two models in terms of surface wave number spectra and seasonal variability. The key findings of the paper are that (i) the mean size of ocean eddies show strong seasonality; (ii) this seasonality is associated with an increased population of submesoscale eddies (10–50 km) in winter; and (iii) the net release of available potential energy associated with mixed layer instability is responsible for the emergence of the increased population of submesoscale eddies in wintertime.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09757},
	abstract = {Neural networks are increasingly used in environmental science applications. Furthermore, neural network models are trained by minimizing a loss function, and it is crucial to choose the loss function very carefully for environmental science applications, as it determines what exactly is being optimized. Standard loss functions do not cover all the needs of the environmental sciences, which makes it important for scientists to be able to develop their own custom loss functions so that they can implement many of the classic performance measures already developed in environmental science, including measures developed for spatial model veriﬁcation. However, there are very few resources available that cover the basics of custom loss function development comprehensively, and to the best of our knowledge none that focus on the needs of environmental scientists. This document seeks to ﬁll this gap by providing a guide on how to write custom loss functions targeted toward environmental science applications. Topics include the basics of writing custom loss functions, common pitfalls, functions to use in loss functions, examples such as fractions skill score as loss function, how to incorporate physical constraints, discrete and soft discretization, and concepts such as focal, robust, and adaptive loss. While examples are currently provided in this guide for Python with Keras and the TensorFlow backend, the basic concepts also apply to other environments, such as Python with PyTorch. Similarly, while the sample loss functions provided here are from meteorology, these are just examples of how to create custom loss functions. Other ﬁelds in the environmental sciences have very similar needs for custom loss functions, e.g., for evaluating spatial forecasts effectively, and the concepts discussed here can be applied there as well. All code samples are provided in a GitHub repository.},

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning}, publisher={PMLR}, author={Ioffe, Sergey and Szegedy, Christian}, year={2015}, month={Jun}, pages={448–456}, language={en} }

A wide range of features from both oceanic (e.g., biological slicks, icebergs, etc.) and meteorologic origin (e.g., rain cells, wind streaks, etc.) are distinguishable on these acquisitions. This paper studies the semantic segmentation of ten metoceanic processes either in the context of a large quantity of image-level groundtruths (i.e., weakly-supervised framework) or of scarce pixel-level groundtruths (i.e., fully-supervised framework). Our main result is that a fully-supervised model outperforms any tested weakly-supervised algorithm. Adding more segmentation examples in the training set would further increase the precision of the predictions. Trained on 20 × 20 km imagettes acquired from the WV acquisition mode of the Sentinel-1 mission, the model is shown to generalize, under some assumptions, to wide-swath SAR data, which further extents its application domain to coastal areas.}, number={44}, journal={Remote Sensing}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Colin, Aurélien and Fablet, Ronan and Tandeo, Pierre and Husson, Romain and Peureux, Charles and Longépé, Nicolas and Mouche, Alexis}, year={2022}, month={Jan}, pages={851}, language={en} }

	abstract = {Implicitly deﬁned, continuous, differentiable signal representations parameterized by neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering many possible beneﬁts over conventional representations. However, current network architectures for such implicit neural representations are incapable of modeling signals with ﬁne detail, and fail to represent a signal’s spatial and temporal derivatives, despite the fact that these are essential to many physical signals deﬁned implicitly as the solution to partial differential equations. We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or SIRENs, are ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. We analyze SIREN activation statistics to propose a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate the representation of images, waveﬁelds, video, sound, and their derivatives. Further, we show how SIRENs can be leveraged to solve challenging boundary value problems, such as particular Eikonal equations (yielding signed distance functions), the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations. Lastly, we combine SIRENs with hypernetworks to learn priors over the space of SIREN functions. Please see the project website for a video overview of the proposed method and all applications.},

Ocean SAR images segmentation differs from classic deep learning problems with a high variety of shapes and a particular importance of high-frequency patterns. To this end, an assessment of deep learning frameworks is performed, with a focus on the comparison between weakly supervised and supervised methods. Metrics based on the Wassertein distance indicate best performances by the supervised segmentation (U-Net) given operational constraints, thus highlighting the significance of properly annotated data sets.

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks.

It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques.

	abstract = {Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It allows expressing complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning. However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difﬁcult to use for practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose a uniﬁed, efﬁcient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our approach, the user deﬁnes directly in Python a function F capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of F and implicit differentiation to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our approach thus combines the beneﬁts of implicit differentiation and autodiff. It is efﬁcient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and modular as the optimality condition speciﬁcation is decoupled from the implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many exiting implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bilevel optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.},

Two-dimensional SSH can be reconstructed using mapping techniques; however, the spatial resolution is quite coarse even when data from several altimeters are analyzed. A new satellite mission based on radar interferometry is scheduled to be launched in 2020. This mission, called Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), will measure SSH at high resolution along a wide swath, thus providing two-dimensional images of the ocean surface topography. This new capability will provide a large amount of data even though they are contaminated with instrument noise and geophysical errors. This paper presents a tool that simulates synthetic observations of SSH from the future SWOT mission using SSH from any ocean general circulation model (OGCM). SWOT-like data have been generated from a high-resolution model and analyzed to investigate the sampling and accuracy characteristics of the future SWOT data. This tool will help explore new ideas and methods for optimizing the retrieval of information from future SWOT missions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Conventional radar altimeter makes measurement of sea surface height (SSH) in one-dimensional profiles along the ground tracks of a satellite. Such profiles are combined via various mapping techniques to construct two-dimensional SSH maps, providing a valuable data record over the past two decades for studying the global ocean circulation and sea level change. However, the spatial resolution of the SSH is limited by both coarse sampling across the satellite tracks and the instrument error in the profile measurements. A new satellite mission based on radar interferometry offers the capability of making high-resolution wide-swath measurement of SSH. This mission is called Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), which will demonstrate the application of swath altimeter to both oceanography and land hydrology. This paper presents a brief introduction to the design of SWOT, its performance specification for SSH, and the anticipated spatial resolution and coverage, demonstrating the promise of SWOT for fundamental advancement in observing SSH. A main objective of the paper is to address issues in the anticipated transition of conventional profile altimetry to swath altimetry in the future—in particular, the need for consistency of the new observing system with the old for extending the existing data record into the future. A viable approach is to carry a profile altimeter in the SWOT payload to provide calibration and validation of the new measurement against the old at large scales. This is the baseline design of SWOT. The unique advantages of the approach are discussed in the context of a new standard for observing the global SSH in the future.},

	abstract = {This paper gives an overview of an empirical cross-calibration technique developed for the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission (SWOT). The method is here used to detect and to mitigate two spatially coherent errors in SWOT topography data: the baseline roll error whose signature is linear across track, and the baseline length error whose signature is quadratic across track. Assuming that topography data are corrupted by coherent error signatures that we can model, we extract the signatures, and we empirically use the error estimates to correct SWOT data. The cross-calibration is tackled with a two-step scheme. The first step is to get local estimates over cross-calibration zones, and the second step is to perform a global interpolation of local error estimates and to mitigate the error everywhere. Three methods are used to get local error estimates: 1) we remove a static first guess reference such as a digital elevation model, 2) we exploit overlapping diamonds between SWOT swaths, and 3) we exploit overlapping segments with traditional pulse-limited altimetry sensors. Then, the along-track propagation is performed taking the local estimates as an input, and an optimal interpolator (1-D objective analysis) constrained with a priori statistical knowledge of the problem. The rationale of this paper is to assume that SWOT's scientific requirements are met on all errors but the ones being cross-calibrated. In other words, the algorithms presented in this paper are not needed at this stage of the mission definition, and they are able to deal with higher error levels (e.g., if hardware constraints are relaxed and replaced by additional ground processing). Even in our most pessimistic theoretical scenarios of baseline roll and baseline length errors (up to 70 cm RMS of uncorrected topography error), the cross-calibration algorithm reduces coherent errors to less than 2 cm (outer edges of the swath). Residual errors are subcentimetric for very low-frequency errors (e.g., orbital revolution). Sensitivity tests highlight the benefits of using additional pulse-limited altimeters and optimal inversion schemes when the problem is more difficult to solve (e.g., wavelengths of less than 1000 km), but also to provide a geographically homogeneous correction that cannot be obtained with SWOT's sampling alone.},

	abstract = {Due to the degeneration problem of sensors, calibration becomes a prerequisite step to retrieve consistent satellite images, especially for the ones from long-term time series. Relative calibration is an economic manner to address the problem. Previous studies leverage the identified no-change pixels (NCPs) between two images for relative calibration. However, the identification of NCPs itself is a very hard task and the inferior detection quality affects the performances significantly. Inspired by the great success of deep learning techniques, in this article, we first develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based relative calibration method, which bypasses the NCP detection. In particular, the ratio of sensor sensitivity coefficients at two time points is directly estimated by feeding the corresponding image pair into our developed CNN regressor. A polynomial function is fitted upon the estimated ratios in time series. We train the CNN regressor based on the multisite calibration results and then conduct experiments on FengYun-3A (FY-3A), FengYun-3B (FY-3B), and FengYun-3C (FY-3C). The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and it outperforms state-of-the-art NCP-based methods.},
